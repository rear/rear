== NAME
rear - bare metal disaster recovery and system migration tool


== SYNOPSIS
*rear* [*-dDsSvV*] [*-r* _KERNEL_] _COMMAND_ [-- _ARGS_...]


== DESCRIPTION
Relax-and-Recover is the leading Open Source disaster recovery solution. It
is a modular framework with many ready-to-go workflows for common situations. 

Relax-and-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can repartition the
system. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup. Restores to
different hardware are possible. Relax-and-Recover can therefore be used as a 
migration tool as well.

Currently Relax-and-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE,
OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl.
sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup as well as a multitude
of backup strategies (incl.  IBM TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup,
Bacula, rsync). This results in a bootable image that os capable of booting
via PXE, DVD/CD, bootable tape or virtual provisioning.

Relax-and-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance
and is there to assist when disaster strikes. Its setup-and-forget nature
removes any excuses for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented.

Recovering from disaster is made very straight-forward by a 2-step recovery
process so that it can be executed by operational teams when required.
When used interactively (e.g. when used for migrating systems), menus help
make decisions to restore to a new (hardware) environment.

Extending Relax-and-Recover is made possible by its modular framework.
Consistent logging and optionally extended output help understand the concepts
behind Relax-and-Recover and help debug during development.

== BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The process of bare metal disaster recovery consists of two parts:

 - Recreate the system layout
 - Restore the data to the system

Most backup software solutions are very good at restoring data but do not
support recreating the system layout. Relax-and-Recover is very good at
recreating the system layout but works best when used together with
supported backup software.

In this combination Relax-and-Recover recreates the system layout and calls
the backup software to restore the actual data. Thus there is no unnessecary
duplicate data storage and the Relax-and-Recover rescue media can be very small.

For demonstration and special use purposes Relax-and-Recover also includes
an internal backup method, NETFS, which can be used to create a simple tar.gz
archive of the system. For all permanent setups we recommend using something
more professional for backup, either a traditional backup software (open
source or commercial) or rsync with hardlink based solutions, e.g. RSYNC
BACKUP MADE EASY.

== RESCUE IMAGE CONFIGURATION
The +OUTPUT+ variable defines where the rescue image should be send to.
Possible +OUTPUT+ setting are:

OUTPUT=*RAMDISK*::
*(Default)* Create only the Relax-and-Recover initramfs.

OUTPUT=*ISO*::
Create a bootable ISO9660 image on disk as _rear-$(hostname).iso_

OUTPUT=*PXE*::
Create on a remote PXE/NFS server the required files (such as
configuration file, kernel and initrd image

OUTPUT=*OBDR*::
Create a bootable OBDR tape (optionally including the backup archive).
Specify the OBDR tape device by using +TAPE_DEVICE+.

OUTPUT=*USB*::
Create a bootable USB disk (using extlinux). Specify the USB storage
device by using +USB_DEVICE+.

When using +OUTPUT=ISO+, +RAMDISK+, +OBDR+ or +USB+ you should provide the 
backup target location through the +OUTPUT_URL+ variable. Possible +OUTPUT_URL+ 
settings are:

OUTPUT_URL=*file://*::
Write the image to disk. The default is in _/var/lib/rear/output/_.

OUTPUT_URL=*fish://*::
Write the image using +lftp+ and the FISH protocol.

OUTPUT_URL=*ftp://*::
Write the image using +lftp+ and the FTP protocol.

OUTPUT_URL=*ftps://*::
Write the image using +lftp+ and the FTPS protocol.

OUTPUT_URL=*hftp://*::
Write the image using +lftp+ and the HFTP protocol.

OUTPUT_URL=*http://*::
Write the image using +lftp+ and the HTTP (PUT) procotol.

OUTPUT_URL=*https://*::
Write the image using +lftp+ and the HTTPS (PUT) protocol.

OUTPUT_URL=*sftp://*::
Write the image using +lftp+ and the secure FTP (SFTP) protocol.

OUTPUT_URL=*rsync://*::
Write the image using +rsync+ and the RSYNC protocol.


== BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION
Currently Relax-and-Recover supports the following backup methods. Please
distinguish carefully between Relax-and-Recover support for 3rd party
backup software and Relax-and-Recover internal backup methods. The latter
also creates a backup of your data while the former will only integrate
Relax-and-Recover with the backup software to restore the data with the
help of the backup software without actually creating backups. This means
that for all non-internal backup software you *must* take care of creating
backups yourself.

Especially the +rear mkbackup+ command can be confusing as it is only
useful for the internal backup methods and has no function at all with
the other backup methods. The following backup methods need to be set
in Relax-and-Recover with the +BACKUP=+ option.

BACKUP=*DP*::
Use HP Data Protector to restore the data.

BACKUP=*EXTERNAL*::
Internal backup method that uses an arbitrary external command to
create a backup and restore the data.

BACKUP=*GALAXY*::
Use CommVault Galaxy 5 to restore the data.

BACKUP=*GALAXY7*::
Use CommVault Galaxy 7 to restore the data.

BACKUP=*NBU*::
Use Symantec NetBackup to restore the data.

BACKUP=*NETFS*::
Internal backup method which can be used to create a simple backup
(tar archive).

BACKUP=*REQUESTRESTORE*::
*(default)* Not really a backup method at all, Relax-and-Recover simply
halts the recovery and requests that somebody will restore the data
to the appropriate location (e.g. via SSH). This method works especially
well with an rsync bases backup that is pushed back to the backup
client.

BACKUP=*RSYNC*::
Use rsync to restore data.

BACKUP=*TSM*::
Use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager to restore the data. The Relax-and-Recover
result files (e.g. ISO image) are also saved into TSM.

If your favourite backup software is missing from this list, please submit
a patch or ask us to implement it for you.

When using +BACKUP=NETFS+ you should provide the backup target location
through
the +BACKUP_URL+ variable. Possible +BACKUP_URL+ settings are:

BACKUP_URL=*file://*::
To backup to local disk, use +BACKUP_URL=file:///directory/path/+

BACKUP_URL=*nfs://*::
To backup to NFS disk, use +BACKUP_URL=nfs://nfs-server-name/share/path+

BACKUP_URL=*tape://*::
To backup to tape device, use +BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0+ or alternatively,
simply define +TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0+

BACKUP_URL=*cifs://*::
To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use
+BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path+. To provide credentials for
CIFS mounting use a _/etc/rear/.cifs_ credentials file and define
+BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"+ and pass along:
+
----
username=_username_
password=_secret password_
domain=_domain_
----

BACKUP_URL=*usb://*::
To backup to USB storage device, use +NETFS=usb:///dev/disk/by-path/REAR-000+
or use a real device node or a specific filesystem label. Alternatively, you
can specify the device using +USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-path/REAR-000+.
+
If you combine this with +OUTPUT=USB+ you will end up with a bootable USB
device.


== CONFIGURATION
To configure Relax-and-Recover you have to edit the configuration files in
_/etc/rear/_.  All _*.conf_ files there are part of the configuration, but
only _site.conf_ and _local.conf_ are intended for the user configuration.
All other configuration files hold defaults for various distributions and
should not be changed.

In _/etc/rear/templates/_ there are also some template files which are used
by Relax-and-Recover to create configuration files (mostly for the boot
environment).  Modify the templates to adjust the information contained in
the emails produced by Relax-and-Recover. You can use these templates to
prepend your own configurations to the configuration files created by
Relax-and-recover, for example you can edit _PXE_pxelinux.cfg_ to add some
general pxelinux configuration you use.

In almost all circumstances you have to configure two main settings and their
parameters: The backup method and the output method.

The backup method defines, how your data was saved and wether Relax-and-Recover
should backup your data as part of the mkrescue process or wether you use an
external application, e.g. backup software to archive your data.

The output method defines how the rescue system is written to disk and how you
plan to boot the failed computer from the rescue system.

See the default configuration file _/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf_ for
an overview of the possible methods and their options.

An example to use TSM for backup and ISO for output would be to add
these lines to _/etc/rear/local.conf_:

    BACKUP=TSM
    OUTPUT=ISO

And if all your systems use NTP for time synchronisation, you can also
add these lines to _/etc/rear/site.conf_

    TIMESYNC=NTP

Don't forget to distribute the _site.conf_ to all your systems.

The resulting ISO image will be created in _/var/lib/rear/output/_.
You can now modify the behaviour by copying the appropriate
configuration variables from _default.conf_ to _local.conf_ and
changing them to suit your environment.


== EXIT STATUS
0::
    Successful program execution.
>0::
    Usage, syntax or execution errors. Check the log file in
    _/var/log/rear/_ for more information.
