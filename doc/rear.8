.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover is the leading Open Source disaster recovery solution\&. It is a modular framework with many ready\-to\-go workflows for common situations\&.
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover produces a bootable image\&. This image can repartition the system\&. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup\&. Restores to different hardware are possible\&. Relax\-and\-Recover can therefore be used as a migration tool as well\&.
.sp
Currently Relax\-and\-Recover supports various boot media (incl\&. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl\&. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup as well as a multitude of backup strategies (incl\&. IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker, EMC Avamar, FDR/Upstream, NovaBACKUP DC, Bareos, Bacula, rsync, rbme, Borg)\&. This results in a bootable image that is capable of booting via PXE, DVD/CD, bootable tape or virtual provisioning\&.
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance and is there to assist when disaster strikes\&. Its setup\-and\-forget nature removes any excuses for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented\&.
.sp
Recovering from disaster is made very straight\-forward by a 2\-step recovery process so that it can be executed by operational teams when required\&. When used interactively (e\&.g\&. when used for migrating systems), menus help make decisions to restore to a new (hardware) environment\&.
.sp
Extending Relax\-and\-Recover is made possible by its modular framework\&. Consistent logging and optionally extended output help understand the concepts behind Relax\-and\-Recover and help debug during development\&.

.SH "BACKGROUND INFORMATION"
.sp
The process of bare metal disaster recovery consists of two parts:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Recreate the system layout
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Restore the data to the system
.RE
.sp
Most backup software solutions are very good at restoring data but do not support recreating the system layout\&. Relax\-and\-Recover is very good at recreating the system layout but works best when used together with supported backup software\&.
.sp
In this combination Relax\-and\-Recover recreates the system layout and calls the backup software to restore the actual data\&. Thus there is no unnecessary duplicate data storage and the Relax\-and\-Recover rescue media can be very small\&.
.sp
For demonstration and special use purposes Relax\-and\-Recover also includes an internal backup method, NETFS, which can be used to create a simple tar\&.gz archive of the system\&. For all permanent setups we recommend using something more professional for backup, either a traditional backup software (open source or commercial) or rsync with hardlink based solutions, e\&.g\&. RSYNC BACKUP MADE EASY\&.
.SH "RESCUE IMAGE CONFIGURATION"
.sp
The OUTPUT variable defines from where our bootable rescue image will be booted and the OUTPUT_URL variable defines where the rescue image should be send to\&. Possible OUTPUT settings are:
.PP
OUTPUT=\fBRAMDISK\fR
.RS 4
Create only the Relax\-and\-Recover initramfs\&.

.RE
.PP

.RE
.RE
.sp
When using OUTPUT=ISO, RAMDISK, OBDR, USB, or RAWDISK you should provide the backup target location through the OUTPUT_URL variable\&. Possible OUTPUT_URL settings are:
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBfile://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image to disk\&. The default is in
\fI/var/lib/rear/output/\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBnfs://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image by mounting the target filesystem via NFS\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBcifs://\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBfish://\fR
.RS 4

lftp
and the FISH protocol\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBftp://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image using
lftp
and the FTP protocol\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBftps://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image using
lftp
and the FTPS protocol\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBhttps://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image using
lftp

.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBsftp://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image using
lftp

.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBrsync://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image using
rsync
and the RSYNC protocol\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBsshfs://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image using sshfs and the SSH protocol\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBnull\fR
.RS 4
Do not copy the rescue image from
\fI/var/lib/rear/output/\fR
to a remote output location\&.
OUTPUT_URL=null
is useful when another program (e\&.g\&. an
\fIexternal\fR
backup program) is used to save the rescue image from the local system to a remote place, or with
BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup
when the backup is included in the rescue image to avoid a (big) copy of the rescue image at a remote output location\&. In the latter case the rescue image must be manually saved from the local system to a remote place\&.
OUTPUT_URL=null
is only supported together with
BACKUP=NETFS\&.
.RE
.sp
If you do not specify OUTPUT_URL variable then by default it will be aligned to what was defined by variable BACKUP_URL\&. And, the rescue image will then be copied to the same location as your backup of the system disk(s)\&.
.sp
The ISO_DEFAULT variable defines what default boot option is used on the rescue image\&. Possible values are manual, boothd or automatic\&. Manual will make you boot into the shell directly by default, boothd will boot to the first disk (default) or automatic will automatically start in recovery mode\&.
.SH "RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"
.sp
When booting the rescue image you can edit the kernel command line\&.
There are some Relax\-and\-Recover specific kernel command line options:
.PP
\fBdebug\fR
.RS 4
The rescue system start up scripts in /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/
are run one by one each one after pressing \fIEnter\fR and
the scripts are run with `set \-x` which prints commands
and their arguments as they are executed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBauto_recover\fR or \fBautomatic\fR
.RS 4
Launch `rear recover` automatically (without automated reboot)\&.
Together with \fIdebug\fR it runs `rear recover` in debug mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunattended\fR
.RS 4
Launch `rear recover` automatically as with \fIauto_recover\fR
plus automated reboot after successful `rear recover`\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBip= nm= netdev= gw=\fR
.RS 4
If IP address plus optionally netmask (default 255\&.255\&.255\&.0),
network device (default eth0), and default gateway are specified
only that single network device is set up\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ip=192\&.168\&.100\&.2 nm=255\&.255\&.255\&.0 netdev=eth0 gw=192\&.168\&.100\&.1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fBnoip\fR
.RS 4
Skip network devices setup by the rescue system start up scripts (overrides \fIip= nm= netdev= gw=\fR)\&.
.RE
.SH "BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION"
.sp
Currently Relax\-and\-Recover supports the following backup methods\&. Please distinguish carefully between Relax\-and\-Recover support for 3rd party backup software and Relax\-and\-Recover internal backup methods\&. The latter also creates a backup of your data while the former will only integrate Relax\-and\-Recover with the backup software to restore the data with the help of the backup software without actually creating backups\&. This means that for all non\-internal backup software you \fBmust\fR take care of creating backups yourself\&.
.sp
Especially the rear mkbackup command can be confusing as it is only useful for the internal backup methods and has no function at all with the other (external) backup methods\&.
.sp
The following backup methods need to be set in Relax\-and\-Recover with the BACKUP option\&. As mentioned we have two types of BACKUP methods \- \fIinternal\fR and \fIexternal\fR\&.
.sp
The following BACKUP methods are \fIexternal\fR of Relax\-and\-Recover meaning that you are responsible of backups being made:
.PP
BACKUP=\fBREQUESTRESTORE\fR
.RS 4
\fB(default)\fR
Not really a backup method at all, Relax\-and\-Recover simply halts the recovery and requests that somebody will restore the data to the appropriate location (e\&.g\&. via SSH)\&. This method works especially well with an rsync based backup that is pushed back to the backup client\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBEXTERNAL\fR

To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use
BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs\-server\-name/share/path\&. To provide credentials for CIFS mounting use a
\fI/etc/rear/cifs\fR
credentials file and define
BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs"
and pass along:

or use a real device node or a specific filesystem label\&. Alternatively, you can specify the device using
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by\-path/REAR\-000\&.
.sp
If you combine this with
OUTPUT=USB
you will end up with a bootable USB device\&.

.sp
When using BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP_PROG=tar there is an option to select BACKUP_TYPE=incremental or BACKUP_TYPE=differential to let rear make incremental or differential backups until the next full backup day e\&.g\&. via FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon" is reached or when the last full backup is too old after FULLBACKUP_OUTDATED_DAYS has passed\&. Incremental or differential backup is currently only known to work with BACKUP_URL=nfs\&. Other BACKUP_URL schemes may work but at least BACKUP_URL=usb requires USB_SUFFIX to be set to work with incremental or differential backup\&.

.sp
To set up an SED, boot the Relax\-and\-Recover rescue system and run `rear opaladmin setupERASE DEVICE` (\fIDEVICE\fR being the disk device path like /dev/sda)\&.
.sp
For complete information, consult the section "Support for TCG Opal 2\-compliant Self\-Encrypting Disks" in the Relax\-and\-Recover user guide\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
To configure Relax\-and\-Recover you have to edit the configuration files in \fI/etc/rear/\fR\&. All \fI*\&.conf\fR files there are part of the configuration, but only \fIsite\&.conf\fR and \fIlocal\&.conf\fR are intended for the user configuration\&. All other configuration files hold defaults for various distributions and should not be changed\&.
.sp
In \fI/etc/rear/templates/\fR there are also some template files which are used by Relax\-and\-Recover to create configuration files (mostly for the boot environment)\&. Modify the templates to adjust the information contained in the emails produced by Relax\-and\-Recover\&. You can use these templates to prepend your own configurations to the configuration files created by Relax\-and\-Recover, for example you can edit \fIPXE_pxelinux\&.cfg\fR to add some general pxelinux configuration you use\&.
.sp
In almost all circumstances you have to configure two main settings and their parameters: The backup method and the output method\&.
.sp
The backup method defines, how your data was saved and whether Relax\-and\-Recover should backup your data as part of the mkrescue process or whether you use an external application, e\&.g\&. backup software to archive your data\&.
.sp
The output method defines how the rescue system is written to disk and how you plan to boot the failed computer from the rescue system\&.
.sp
See the default configuration file \fI/usr/share/rear/conf/default\&.conf\fR for an overview of the possible methods and their options\&.
.sp
An example to use TSM for backup and ISO for output would be to add these lines to \fI/etc/rear/local\&.conf\fR (no need to define a BACKUP_URL when using an external backup solution):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
BACKUP=TSM
OUTPUT=ISO
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
And if all your systems use NTP for time synchronisation, you can also add these lines to \fI/etc/rear/site\&.conf\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
TIMESYNC=NTP
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Do not forget to distribute the \fIsite\&.conf\fR to all your systems\&.
.sp
The resulting ISO image will be created in \fI/var/lib/rear/output/\fR\&. You can now modify the behaviour by copying the appropriate configuration variables from \fIdefault\&.conf\fR to \fIlocal\&.conf\fR and changing them to suit your environment\&.

The ReaR project was initiated in 2006 by Schlomo Schapiro (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/schlomo\fR\m[]) and Gratien D\(cqhaese (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/gdha\fR\m[]) and has since then seen a lot of contributions by many authors\&. As ReaR deals with bare metal disaster recovery, there is a large amount of code that was contributed by owners and users of specialized hardware and software\&. Without their combined efforts and contributions ReaR would not be the universal Linux bare metal disaster recovery solution that it is today\&.
.sp
As time passed the project was lucky to get the support of additional developers to also help as maintainers: Dag Wieers (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/dagwieers\fR\m[]), Jeroen Hoekx (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/jhoekx\fR\m[]), Johannes Meixner (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/jsmeix\fR\m[]), Vladimir Gozora (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/gozora\fR\m[]) and S\('ebastien Chabrolles (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/schabrolles\fR\m[])\&. We hope that ReaR continues to prove useful and to attract more developers who agree to be maintainers\&. Please refer to the MAINTAINERS (\m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/rear/rear/blob/master/MAINTAINERS\fR\m[]) file for the list of active and past maintainers\&.
