.SH "NAME"
rear \- bare metal disaster recovery and system migration tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover is the leading Open Source disaster recovery solution\&. It is a modular framework with many ready\-to\-go workflows for common situations\&.
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover produces a bootable image\&. This image can repartition the system\&. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup\&. Restores to different hardware are possible\&. Relax\-and\-Recover can therefore be used as a migration tool as well\&.
.sp
Currently Relax\-and\-Recover supports various boot media (incl\&. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl\&. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup as well as a multitude of backup strategies (incl\&. IBM TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, Bacula, rsync)\&. This results in a bootable image that os capable of booting via PXE, DVD/CD, bootable tape or virtual provisioning\&.
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance and is there to assist when disaster strikes\&. Its setup\-and\-forget nature removes any excuses for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented\&.
.sp
Recovering from disaster is made very straight\-forward by a 2\-step recovery process so that it can be executed by operational teams when required\&. When used interactively (e\&.g\&. when used for migrating systems), menus help make decisions to restore to a new (hardware) environment\&.
.sp
Extending Relax\-and\-Recover is made possible by its modular framework\&. Consistent logging and optionally extended output help understand the concepts behind Relax\-and\-Recover and help debug during development\&.

.SH "BACKGROUND INFORMATION"
.sp
The process of bare metal disaster recovery consists of two parts:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Recreate the system layout
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Restore the data to the system
.RE
.sp
Most backup software solutions are very good at restoring data but do not support recreating the system layout\&. Relax\-and\-Recover is very good at recreating the system layout but works best when used together with supported backup software\&.
.sp
In this combination Relax\-and\-Recover recreates the system layout and calls the backup software to restore the actual data\&. Thus there is no unnessecary duplicate data storage and the Relax\-and\-Recover rescue media can be very small\&.
.sp
For demonstration and special use purposes Relax\-and\-Recover also includes an internal backup method, NETFS, which can be used to create a simple tar\&.gz archive of the system\&. For all permanent setups we recommend using something more professional for backup, either a traditional backup software (open source or commercial) or rsync with hardlink based solutions, e\&.g\&. RSYNC BACKUP MADE EASY\&.
.SH "RESCUE IMAGE CONFIGURATION"
.sp
The OUTPUT variable defines where the rescue image should be send to\&. Possible OUTPUT setting are:
.PP
OUTPUT=\fBRAMDISK\fR
.RS 4

\fB(Default)\fR
Create only the Relax\-and\-Recover initramfs\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT=\fBISO\fR
.RS 4
Create a bootable ISO9660 image on disk as
\fIrear\-$(hostname)\&.iso\fR
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT=\fBPXE\fR
.RS 4
Create on a remote PXE/NFS server the required files (such as configuration file, kernel and initrd image
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT=\fBOBDR\fR
.RS 4

TAPE_DEVICE\&.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT=\fBUSB\fR
.RS 4

USB_DEVICE\&.
.RE
.sp
When using OUTPUT=ISO, RAMDISK, OBDR or USB you should provide the backup target location through the OUTPUT_URL variable\&. Possible OUTPUT_URL settings are:
.PP
OUTPUT_URL=\fBfile://\fR
.RS 4
Write the image to disk\&. The default is in
\fI/var/lib/rear/output/\fR\&.

.RE
.SH "BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION"
.sp
Currently Relax\-and\-Recover supports the following backup methods\&. Please distinguish carefully between Relax\-and\-Recover support for 3rd party backup software and Relax\-and\-Recover internal backup methods\&. The latter also creates a backup of your data while the former will only integrate Relax\-and\-Recover with the backup software to restore the data with the help of the backup software without actually creating backups\&. This means that for all non\-internal backup software you \fBmust\fR take care of creating backups yourself\&.
.sp
Especially the rear mkbackup command can be confusing as it is only useful for the internal backup methods and has no function at all with the other backup methods\&. The following backup methods need to be set in Relax\-and\-Recover with the BACKUP= option\&.
.PP
BACKUP=\fBDP\fR
.RS 4
Use HP Data Protector to restore the data\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBEXTERNAL\fR
.RS 4
Internal backup method that uses an arbitrary external command to create a backup and restore the data\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBGALAXY\fR
.RS 4
Use CommVault Galaxy 5 to restore the data\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBGALAXY7\fR
.RS 4
Use CommVault Galaxy 7 to restore the data\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBNBU\fR
.RS 4
Use Symantec NetBackup to restore the data\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBNETFS\fR
.RS 4
Internal backup method which can be used to create a simple backup (tar archive)\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBREQUESTRESTORE\fR
.RS 4

\fB(default)\fR
Not really a backup method at all, Relax\-and\-Recover simply halts the recovery and requests that somebody will restore the data to the appropriate location (e\&.g\&. via SSH)\&. This method works especially well with an rsync bases backup that is pushed back to the backup client\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBRSYNC\fR
.RS 4
Use rsync to restore data\&.
.RE
.PP
BACKUP=\fBTSM\fR
.RS 4
Use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager to restore the data\&. The Relax\-and\-Recover result files (e\&.g\&. ISO image) are also saved into TSM\&.
.RE
.sp
If your favourite backup software is missing from this list, please submit a patch or ask us to implement it for you\&.
.sp
When using BACKUP=NETFS you should provide the backup target location through the BACKUP_URL variable\&. Possible BACKUP_URL settings are:
.PP
BACKUP_URL=\fBfile://\fR
.RS 4
To backup to local disk, use
BACKUP_URL=file:///directory/path/
.RE
.PP
BACKUP_URL=\fBnfs://\fR
.RS 4
To backup to NFS disk, use
BACKUP_URL=nfs://nfs\-server\-name/share/path
.RE
.PP
BACKUP_URL=\fBtape://\fR
.RS 4
To backup to tape device, use
BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0
or alternatively, simply define
TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
.RE
.PP
BACKUP_URL=\fBcifs://\fR
.RS 4
To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use
BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs\-server\-name/share/path\&. To provide credentials for CIFS mounting use a
\fI/etc/rear/\&.cifs\fR
credentials file and define
BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/\&.cifs"
and pass along:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
username=_username_
password=_secret password_
domain=_domain_
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
BACKUP_URL=\fBusb://\fR
.RS 4
To backup to USB storage device, use
NETFS=usb:///dev/disk/by\-path/REAR\-000
or use a real device node or a specific filesystem label\&. Alternatively, you can specify the device using
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by\-path/REAR\-000\&.
.sp
If you combine this with
OUTPUT=USB
you will end up with a bootable USB device\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
To configure Relax\-and\-Recover you have to edit the configuration files in \fI/etc/rear/\fR\&. All \fI*\&.conf\fR files there are part of the configuration, but only \fIsite\&.conf\fR and \fIlocal\&.conf\fR are intended for the user configuration\&. All other configuration files hold defaults for various distributions and should not be changed\&.
.sp
In \fI/etc/rear/templates/\fR there are also some template files which are used by Relax\-and\-Recover to create configuration files (mostly for the boot environment)\&. Modify the templates to adjust the information contained in the emails produced by Relax\-and\-Recover\&. You can use these templates to prepend your own configurations to the configuration files created by Relax\-and\-recover, for example you can edit \fIPXE_pxelinux\&.cfg\fR to add some general pxelinux configuration you use\&.
.sp
In almost all circumstances you have to configure two main settings and their parameters: The backup method and the output method\&.
.sp
The backup method defines, how your data was saved and wether Relax\-and\-Recover should backup your data as part of the mkrescue process or wether you use an external application, e\&.g\&. backup software to archive your data\&.
.sp
The output method defines how the rescue system is written to disk and how you plan to boot the failed computer from the rescue system\&.
.sp
See the default configuration file \fI/usr/share/rear/conf/default\&.conf\fR for an overview of the possible methods and their options\&.
.sp
An example to use TSM for backup and ISO for output would be to add these lines to \fI/etc/rear/local\&.conf\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
BACKUP=TSM
OUTPUT=ISO
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
And if all your systems use NTP for time synchronisation, you can also add these lines to \fI/etc/rear/site\&.conf\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
TIMESYNC=NTP
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Don\(cqt forget to distribute the \fIsite\&.conf\fR to all your systems\&.
.sp
The resulting ISO image will be created in \fI/var/lib/rear/output/\fR\&. You can now modify the behaviour by copying the appropriate configuration variables from \fIdefault\&.conf\fR to \fIlocal\&.conf\fR and changing them to suit your environment\&.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
