.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover (abbreviated ReaR) is the leading Open Source disaster recovery solution.
It is a modular framework with many ready\-to\-go workflows for common situations.
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can repartition the
system. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup. Restores to
different hardware are possible. Relax\-and\-Recover can therefore be used as a
migration tool as well.
.sp
Currently Relax\-and\-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE,
OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl.
sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup as well as a multitude
of backup strategies (incl.  IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, MircoFocus Data Protector,
Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker, EMC Avamar, FDR/Upstream, NovaStor DC, Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM),
Bareos, Bacula, rsync, rbme, Borg). This results in a bootable image that is capable of
booting via PXE, DVD/CD, bootable tape or virtual provisioning.
.sp
Relax\-and\-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance
and is there to assist when disaster strikes. Its setup\-and\-forget nature
removes any excuses for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented.
.sp
Recovering from disaster is made very straight\-forward by a 2\-step recovery
process so that it can be executed by operational teams when required.
When used interactively (e.g. when used for migrating systems), menus help
make decisions to restore to a new (hardware) environment.
.sp
Extending Relax\-and\-Recover is made possible by its modular framework.
Consistent logging and optionally extended output help understand the concepts
behind Relax\-and\-Recover and help debug during development.

.SH "BACKGROUND INFORMATION"
.sp
The process of bare metal disaster recovery consists of two parts:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Recreate the system layout
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Restore the data to the system
.RE
.sp
Most backup software solutions are very good at restoring data but do not
support recreating the system layout. Relax\-and\-Recover is very good at
recreating the system layout but works best when used together with
supported backup software.
.sp
In this combination Relax\-and\-Recover recreates the system layout and calls
the backup software to restore the actual data. Thus there is no unnecessary
duplicate data storage and the Relax\-and\-Recover rescue media can be very small.
.sp
For demonstration and special use purposes Relax\-and\-Recover also includes
an internal backup method, NETFS, which can be used to create a simple tar.gz
archive of the system. For all permanent setups we recommend using something
more professional for backup, either a traditional backup software (open
source or commercial) or rsync with hardlink based solutions, e.g. RSYNC
BACKUP MADE EASY.
.SH "RESCUE IMAGE CONFIGURATION"
.sp
The OUTPUT variable defines from where our bootable rescue image will be
booted and the OUTPUT_URL variable defines where the rescue image should be
send to. Possible OUTPUT settings are:
.sp
OUTPUT=\fBRAMDISK\fP
.RS 4

.RE
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT=\fBPORTABLE\fP
.RS 4
Create a portable ReaR archive that can be used on any rescue system to run
any ReaR workflow, especially recover. Assumes that all required software is
installed and usable there. This is experimental, please report any issues.
.RE
.sp
When using OUTPUT=ISO, RAMDISK, OBDR, USB, PORTABLE or RAWDISK you should
provide the backup target location through the OUTPUT_URL variable. Possible
OUTPUT_URL settings are:
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBfile://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image to disk. The default is in \fI/var/lib/rear/output/\fP.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBnfs://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image by mounting the target filesystem via NFS.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBcifs://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image by mounting the target filesystem via CIFS.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBfish://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using lftp and the FISH protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBftp://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using lftp and the FTP protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBftps://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using lftp and the FTPS protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBhftp://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using lftp and the HFTP protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBhttp://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using lftp and the HTTP (PUT) procotol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBhttps://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using lftp and the HTTPS (PUT) protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBsftp://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using lftp and the secure FTP (SFTP) protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBrsync://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using rsync and the RSYNC protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBsshfs://\fP
.RS 4
Write the image using sshfs and the SSH protocol.
.RE
.sp
OUTPUT_URL=\fBnull\fP
.RS 4
Do not copy the rescue image from \fI/var/lib/rear/output/\fP to a remote output location.
OUTPUT_URL=null is useful when another program (e.g. an \fIexternal\fP backup program)
is used to save the rescue image from the local system to a remote place,
or with BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup when the backup is included in the rescue image
to avoid a (big) copy of the rescue image at a remote output location.
In the latter case the rescue image must be manually saved from the local system to a remote place.
OUTPUT_URL=null is only supported together with BACKUP=NETFS.
.RE
.sp
If you do not specify OUTPUT_URL variable then by default it will be aligned to what
was defined by variable BACKUP_URL. And, the rescue image will then be copied to the same
location as your backup of the system disk(s).
.sp
The ISO_DEFAULT variable defines what default boot option is used on the rescue image.
Possible values are \f(CRmanual\fP, \f(CRboothd\fP or \f(CRautomatic\fP. Manual will make you boot into
the shell directly by default, boothd will boot to the first disk (default) or automatic
will automatically start in recovery mode.
.SH "RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"
.sp
When booting the rescue image you can edit the kernel command line.
There are some Relax\-and\-Recover specific kernel command line options:
.sp
\fBdebug\fP
.RS 4
The rescue system start up scripts in /etc/scripts/system\-setup.d/
are run one by one each one after pressing \*(AqEnter\*(Aq and
the scripts are run with \*(Aqset \-x\*(Aq which prints commands
and their arguments as they are executed.
.RE
.sp
\fBauto_recover\fP or \fBautomatic\fP
.RS 4
Launch \*(Aqrear recover\*(Aq automatically (without automated reboot).
Together with \*(Aqdebug\*(Aq it runs \*(Aqrear recover\*(Aq in debugscript mode.
.RE
.sp
\fBunattended\fP
.RS 4
Launch \*(Aqrear recover\*(Aq automatically as with \*(Aqauto_recover\*(Aq
plus automated reboot after successful \*(Aqrear recover\*(Aq.
.RE
.sp
\fBip= nm= netdev= gw=\fP
.RS 4
When IP address plus optionally netmask (default 255.255.255.0),
network device (default eth0), and default gateway are specified,
then only that single network device is set up. Example:
.RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
ip=192.168.100.2 nm=255.255.255.0 netdev=eth0 gw=192.168.100.1
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
\fBnoip\fP
.RS 4
Skip network devices setup by the rescue system start up scripts (overrides ip= nm= netdev= gw=).
.RE
.SH "BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION"
.sp
Currently Relax\-and\-Recover supports the below listed backup methods.
.sp
There is a distinction between Relax\-and\-Recover support for 3rd party
backup software and Relax\-and\-Recover internal backup methods. The latter
also creates a backup of your data while the former will only integrate
Relax\-and\-Recover with the backup software to restore the data with the
help of the backup software without actually creating backups. This means
that for all non\-internal backup software you \fBmust\fP take care of creating
backups yourself (unless otherwise noted).
.sp
Especially the rear mkbackup command can be confusing as it is only
useful for the internal backup methods and has usually no function at all with
the other (external) backup methods where the rear mkrescue command applies.
.sp
The following backup methods need to
be set in Relax\-and\-Recover with the BACKUP option. As mentioned we have
two types of BACKUP methods \- \fIinternal\fP and \fIexternal\fP.
.sp
The following BACKUP methods are \fIexternal\fP of Relax\-and\-Recover meaning
that usually you are responsible of backups being made:
.sp
BACKUP=\fBREQUESTRESTORE\fP
.RS 4
\fB(default)\fP Not really a backup method at all, Relax\-and\-Recover simply
halts the recovery and requests that somebody will restore the data
to the appropriate location (e.g. via SSH). This method works especially
well with an rsync based backup that is pushed back to the backup
client.
.RE
.sp
BACKUP=\fBEXTERNAL\fP
.RS 4
Internal backup method that uses an arbitrary external command to
create a backup and restore the data.
.RE
.sp
BACKUP=\fBDP\fP

BACKUP=\fBNBU\fP
.RS 4
Use Symantec NetBackup to restore the data.
.RE
.sp
BACKUP=\fBTSM\fP
.RS 4
Use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager to restore the data. The Relax\-and\-Recover

BACKUP=\fBNFS4SERVER\fP
.RS 4
This is a restore only method. ReaR starts a NFSv4 server in the restore stage and
provides the to be restored filesystems as NFSv4 share. Another

When using BACKUP=NETFS you must provide the backup target location
through the BACKUP_URL variable. Possible BACKUP_URL settings are:
.sp
BACKUP_URL=\fBfile://\fP

CIFS mounting use a \fI/etc/rear/cifs\fP credentials file and define
BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs" and pass along:

To backup to USB storage device, use BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by\-label/REAR\-000
or use a partition device node or a specific filesystem label. Alternatively, you
may specify the partition device using USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by\-label/REAR\-000 if needed.
.sp
If you combine this with OUTPUT=USB you will end up with a bootable USB
device.
.RE

BACKUP_URL=\fBsshfs://\fP
.RS 4
To backup to a remote server via sshfs (SSH protocol), use
BACKUP_URL=sshfs://user@remote\-system.name.org/home/user/backup\-dir/

It is advisable to add \fBServerAliveInterval 15\fP in the /root/.ssh/config
file for the remote system (remote\-system.name.org).
.RE
.sp
BACKUP_URL=\fBiso://\fP
.RS 4
To include the backup within the ISO image. It is important that the BACKUP_URL and

incremental or differential backups until the next full backup day
e.g. via FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon" is reached or when the last full backup
is too old after FULLBACKUP_OUTDATED_DAYS has passed.
Incremental or differential backup is currently only known to work
with BACKUP_URL=nfs. Other BACKUP_URL schemes may work but
at least BACKUP_URL=usb requires USB_SUFFIX to be set
to work with incremental or differential backup.

To set up an SED, boot the Relax\-and\-Recover rescue system and run \f(CRrear
opaladmin setupERASE DEVICE\fP (\fIDEVICE\fP being the disk device path like
\f(CR/dev/sda\fP).
.sp
For complete information, consult the section "Support for TCG Opal 2\-compliant
Self\-Encrypting Disks" in the Relax\-and\-Recover user guide.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
To configure Relax\-and\-Recover you have to edit the configuration files in
\fI/etc/rear/\fP.  All \fI*.conf\fP files there are part of the configuration, but
only \fIsite.conf\fP and \fIlocal.conf\fP are intended for the user configuration.
All other configuration files hold defaults for various distributions and
should not be changed.
.sp
In \fI/etc/rear/templates/\fP there are also some template files which are used
by Relax\-and\-Recover to create configuration files (mostly for the boot
environment).  Modify the templates to adjust the information contained in
the emails produced by Relax\-and\-Recover. You can use these templates to
prepend your own configurations to the configuration files created by
Relax\-and\-Recover, for example you can edit \fIPXE_pxelinux.cfg\fP to add some
general pxelinux configuration you use.
.sp
In almost all circumstances you have to configure two main settings and their
parameters: The backup method and the output method.
.sp
The backup method defines, how your data is to be saved and whether Relax\-and\-Recover
should backup your data as part of the mkbackup workflow for internal backup methods
or whether you use 3rd party backup software to archive your data.
.sp
The output method defines how the rescue system is written to disk and how you
plan to boot the failed computer from the rescue system.
.sp
See the default configuration file \fI/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\fP for
an overview of the possible methods and their options.
.sp
An example to use TSM for backup and ISO for output would be to add
these lines to \fI/etc/rear/local.conf\fP (no need to define a BACKUP_URL
when using an external backup solution):
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
BACKUP=TSM
OUTPUT=ISO
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
And if all your systems use NTP for time synchronisation, you can also
add these lines to \fI/etc/rear/site.conf\fP
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
TIMESYNC=NTP
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Do not forget to distribute the \fIsite.conf\fP to all your systems.
.sp

The ReaR project was initiated in 2006 by Schlomo Schapiro (\c
.URL "https://github.com/schlomo" "" ")"
and
Gratien D\(cqhaese (\c
.URL "https://github.com/gdha" "" ")"
and has since then seen a lot of contributions by many authors.
As ReaR deals with bare metal disaster recovery, there is a large amount of code
that was contributed by owners and users of specialized hardware and software.
Without their combined efforts and contributions ReaR would not be
the universal Linux bare metal disaster recovery solution that it is today.
