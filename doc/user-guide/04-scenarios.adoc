//        and the below content +

//       using different output methods

= Scenarios

== Bootable ISO
If you simply want a bootable ISO on a central server, you would do:

[source,bash]
----
OUTPUT=ISO
OUTPUT_URL=http://server/path-to-push/
----

== Bootable ISO with an external (commercial) backup software
If you rely on your backup software to do the full restore of a system then you could define:

[source,bash]
----
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=[TSM|NSR|DP|NBU|GALAXY10|SEP|DUPLICITY|BACULA|BAREOS|RBME|FDRUPSTREAM]
----

When using one of the above backup solution (commercial or open source) then there is no need to use +rear mkbackup+ as the backup workflow would be empty. Just use +rear mkrescue+

Rear will incorporate the needed executables and libraries of your chosen backup solution into the rescue image of rear.

== Bootable ISO and storing archive on NFS/NAS
To create an ISO rescue image and using a central NFS/NAS server to store the archive, you could define:

[source,bash]
----
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=nfs://remote-nfs-server/exports
#BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED=1
#BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY="my_Secret_pw"
----

The above example shows that it is even possible to protect the archives with a password.  Be aware, that the password entry +BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY="my_Secret_pw"+ will be deleted in the +/etc/rear/local.conf+ file within the rescue image. So, it is important to remember the password (if you use the rescue image months later could cause problems I guess).


== Bootable USB device with backup to USB
If you want a bootable USB device with a (tar) backup to USB as well, you
would use:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=NETFS
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
----


== Bootable tape drive (OBDR) with backup to tape
If you want an OBDR image and backup on tape, and use GNU tar for
backup/restore, you would use:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=NETFS
OUTPUT=OBDR
TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
----


== Bootable tape drive (OBDR) and Bacula restore
If you want an OBDR image on tape, and the Bacula tools to recover your
backup, use:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=BACULA
OUTPUT=OBDR
TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
----

== Using Relax-and-Recover with USB storage devices
Using USB devices with Relax-and-Recover can be appealing for several reasons:

 - If you only need to have a bootable rescue environment, a USB device is
   a *cheap device* for storing only 25 to 60MB to boot from

 - You can leave the USB device inserted in the system and *opt-in booting*
   from it only when disaster hits (although we do recommend storing rescue
   environments off-site)

 - You can *store multiple systems and multiple snapshots* on a single device

 - In case you have plenty of space, it might be a simple solution to store
   complete Disaster Recovery images (rescue + backup) on a single device for
   a set of systems

 - For migrating a bunch of servers having a single device to boot from might
   be very appealing

 - We have implemented a specific workflow: inserting a REAR-000 labeled USB
   stick will invoke +rear udev+ and adds a rescue environment to the USB
   stick (updating the bootloader if needed)

However USB devices may be slow for backup purposes, especially on older
systems or with unreliable/cheap devices.

=== Configuring Relax-and-Recover for USB storage devices
The below configuration (_/etc/rear/local.conf_) gives a list of possible
options when you want to run Relax-and-Recover with USB storage.

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=BACULA
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
----

IMPORTANT: On RHEL4 or older there are no _/dev/disk/by-label/_ udev aliases,
           which means we cannot use device by label. However it is possible
           to use +by-path+ references, however this makes it very specific
           to the USB port used.  We opted to use the complete device-name,
           which can be dangerous if you may have other _/dev/sdX_ devices
           (luckily we have CCISS block devices in _/dev/cciss/_).


=== Preparing your USB storage device
To prepare your USB device for use with Relax-and-Recover, do: +rear format /dev/sdX+

This will create a single partition, make it bootable, format it with ext3,
label it +REAR-000+ and disable warnings related filesystem check for the
device.


=== USB storage as rescue media

==== Configuring Relax-and-Recover to have Bacula tools
If the rescue environment needs additional tools and workflow, this can be
specified by using +BACKUP=BACULA+ in the configuration file
_/etc/rear/local.conf_:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=BACULA
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
----

==== Making the rescue USB storage device
To create a rescue USB device, run +rear -v mkrescue+ as shown below after
you have inserted a *REAR-000* labeled USB device. Make sure the device name
for the USB device is what is configured for +USB_DEVICE+.

----
[root@system ~]# rear -v mkrescue
Relax-and-Recover 1.12.0svn497 / 2011-07-11
Creating disk layout.
Creating root filesystem layout
Copying files and directories
Copying program files and libraries
Copying kernel modules
Creating initramfs
Finished in 72 seconds.
----

WARNING: Doing the above may replace the existing MBR of the USB device.
         However any other content on the device is retained.


[[booting-from-usb]]
==== Booting from USB storage device
Before you can recover our DR backup, it is important to configure the BIOS to
boot from the USB device. In some cases it is required to go into the BIOS setup
(+F9+ during boot) to change the boot-order of devices. (In BIOS setup select
+Standard Boot Order (IPL)+)

Once booted from the USB device, select the system you like to recover from
the list. If you don't press a key within 30 seconds, the system will try to
boot from the local disk.

WARNING: Booting from a local disk may fail when booting from a USB device.
         This is caused by the fact that the GRUB bootloader on the local
         disk is configured as if it is being the first drive +(hd0)+ but
         it is in fact the second disk +(hd1)+. If you do find menu entries
         not working from GRUB, please remove the +root (hd0,0)+ line from
         the entry.

Then select the image you would like to recover.

The system is now ready to restore from Bacula. You can use the 'bls' command
to get information from your Volume, and 'bextract' to restore jobs from your
Volume. It is assumed that you know what is necessary to restore - typically
it will be a full backup.

You can find useful Bacula commands in the shell history. When finished, type
'exit' in the shell to continue recovery.

WARNING: The new root is mounted under '/mnt/local'.

[[restoring-from-bacula-tape]]
==== Restoring from Bacula tape
Now you need to continue with restoring the actual Bacula backup, for this you
have multiple options of which +bextract+ is the most easy and
straightforward, but also the slowest and unsafest.


===== Using a bootstrap file
If you know the JobId of the latest successful full backup, and differential
backups the most efficient way to restore is by creating a bootstrap file with
this information and using it to restore from tape.

A bootstrap file looks like this:

----
Volume = VOL-1234
JobId = 914
Job = Bkp_Daily
----

or

----
Volume = VOL-1234
VolSessionId = 1
VolSessionTime = 108927638
----

Using a bootstrap file with bextract is easy, simply do:
+bextract -b bootstrap.txt Ultrium-1 /mnt/local+

TIP: It helps to know exactly how many files you need to restore, and using
     the +FileIndex+ and +Count+ keywords so +bextract+ does not require to
     read the whole tape. Use the commands in your shell history to access
     an example Bacula bootstrap file.


===== Using bextract
To use +bextract+ to restore *everything* from a single tape, you can do:
+bextract -V VOLUME-NAME Ultrium-1 /mnt/local+

== Using Relax-and-Recover with OBDR tapes
Using One-Button-Disaster-Recovery (OBDR) tapes has a few benefits.

 - Within large organisations tape media is already *part of a workflow*
   for offsite storage and is a *known and trusted technology*

 - Tapes can store large amounts of data reliably and restoring large
   amounts of data is *predictable* in time and effort

 - OBDR offers *booting from tapes*, which is very convenient

 - A single tape can hold both the rescue image as well as a *complete
   snapshot* of the system (up to 1.6TB with LTO4)

However, you need one tape per system as an OBDR tape can only store one
single rescue environment.


=== Configuring Relax-and-Recover for OBDR rescue tapes
The below configuration (_/etc/rear/local.conf_) gives a list of possible
options when you want to run Relax-and-Recover with a tape drive. This
example shows how to use the tape *only* for storing the rescue image,
the backup is expected to be handled by Bacula and so the Bacula tools
are included in the rescue environment to enable a Bacula restore.

[source,bash]
----
OUTPUT=OBDR
TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
----


=== Preparing your OBDR rescue tape
To protect normal backup tapes (in case tape drives are also used by another
backup solution) Relax-and-Recover expects that the tape to use is labeled
*REAR-000*.  To achieve this is to insert a blank tape to use for
Relax-and-Recover and run the +rear format /dev/stX+ command.


=== OBDR tapes as rescue media

==== Configuring Relax-and-Recover to have Bacula tools
If the rescue environment needs additional tools and workflow, this can be
spcified by using +BACKUP=BACULA+ in the configuration file
_/etc/rear/local.conf_:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=BACULA
OUTPUT=OBDR
BEXTRACT_DEVICE=Ultrium-1
BEXTRACT_VOLUME=VOL-*
----

Using the +BEXTRACT_DEVICE+ allows you to use the tape device that is
referenced from the Bacula configuration. This helps in those cases where the
discovery of the various tape drives has already been done and configured in
Bacula.

The +BEXTRACT_VOLUME+ variable is optional and is only displayed in the
restore instructions on screen as an aid during recovery.


==== Making the OBDR rescue tape
To create a rescue environment that can boot from an OBDR tape, simply run
+rear -v mkrescue+ with a *REAR-000* -labeled tape inserted.

----

WARNING: The message above about _/dev/cciss/c1d0_ not being used makes sense

[[booting-from-obdr]]
==== Booting from OBDR rescue tape
The One Button Disaster Recovery (OBDR) functionality in HP LTO Ultrium drives
enables them to emulate CD-ROM devices in specific circumstances (also known
as being in ''Disaster Recovery'' mode). The drive can then act as a boot
device for PCs that support booting off CD-ROM.

TIP: An OBDR capable drive can be switched into CD-ROM mode by *powering on
     with the eject button held down*. Make sure you keep it pressed when the
     tape drive regains power, and then release the button. If the drive is in
     OBDR mode, the light will blink regularly. This might be easier in some
     cases than the below procedure, hence the name One Button Disaster
     Recovery !


===== Using a HP Smart Array controller
To boot from OBDR, boot your system with the Relax-and-Recover tape inserted.
During the boot sequence, interrupt the HP Smart Array controller with the
tape attached by pressing *F8* (or *Escape-8* on serial console).

  Press <ESC> to skip configuration and continue
----

Then select *Configure OBDR* in the menu and select the Tape drive by marking
it with *X* (default is on) and press *ENTER* and *F8* to activate this change
so it displays ''Configuration saved''.

Then press *ENTER* and *Escape* to leave the Smart Array controller BIOS.

----

===== Using an LSI controller
To boot from OBDR when using an LSI controller, boot your system with the
Relax-and-Recover tape inserted. During the boot sequence, interrupt the
LSI controller BIOS that has the tape attached by pressing *F8* (or
*Escape-8* on serial console).

==== Restoring from Bacula tape
See the section <<restoring-from-bacula-tape,Restoring from Bacula tape>>
for more information about how to restore a Bacula tape.


=== OBDR tapes as backup media
An OBDR backup tape is similar to an OBDR rescue tape, but next to the rescue
environment, it also consists of a complete backup of the system. This is
very convenient in that a single tape can be use for disaster recovery, and
recovery is much more simple and completely automated.

CAUTION: Please make sure that the system fits onto a single tape uncompressed.
         For an LTO4 Ultrium that would mean no more than 1.6TB.


==== Configuring Relax-and-Recover for OBDR backup tapes
The below configuration (_/etc/rear/local.conf_) gives a list of possible
