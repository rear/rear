= Introduction

Relax-and-Recover is the leading Open Source disaster recovery solution. It
is a modular framework with many ready-to-go workflows for common situations. 

Relax-and-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can repartition the
system. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup. Restores to
different hardware are possible. Relax-and-Recover can therefore be used as a 
migration tool as well.

Currently Relax-and-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE,
OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl.
sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) as well as a multitude of backup strategies
(incl.  IBM TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, Bacula, rsync).

Relax-and-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance
and is there to assist when disaster strikes. Its setup-and-forget nature
removes any excuse for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented.

Recovering from disaster is made very straight-forward by a 2-step recovery
process so that it can be executed by operational teams when required.
When used interactively (e.g. when used for migrating systems), menus help
make decisions to restore to a new (hardware) environment.

Extending and integrating Relax-and-Recover into complex environments is made
possible by its modular framework. Consistent logging and optionally extended
output help understand the concepts behind Relax-and-Recover, troubleshoot
during initial configuration and help debug during integration.

Professional services and support are available.

== Design concepts
At the start of the project a set of groundrules were defined and over time
improved:

 - Focus on Disaster Recovery
 - Modular design
 - For Linux (and possibly other Unix-like operating systems)
 - Few external dependencies (Bash and standard Unix tools)
 - Easy to use and easy to extend

The aim is to make Relax-and-Recover as least demanding as possible, it will
require only the applications neccessary to fulfill the job Relax-and-Recover
is configured for.

Furthermore, Relax-and-Recover should be platform independant and ideally
install just as a set of scripts that utilizes everything that the Linux OS
provides.


== Features and functionality
Relax-and-Recover has a wide range of features:

// FIXME: Insert the various features from the Release Notes +
//        include the information from the presentations +
//        and optionally the rescue creation and recovery workflow
// FIXME: Get rid of the below list when everything is in the feature set

 - Improvements to HP SmartArray and CCISS driver integration
 - Improvements to software RAID integration
 - Disk layout change detection for monitoring
 - One-Button-Disaster-Recovery (OBDR) tape support
 - DRBD filesystem support
 - Bacula tape support
 - Multiple DR images per system on single USB storage device
 - USB ext3/ext4 support
 - GRUB bootloader re-implementation
 - Add Relax-and-Recover entry to local GRUB configuration
 - Nagios and webmin integration
 - Syslinux boot menu
 - Storing rescue/backup logfile on rescue media
 - Restoring to different hardware
 - RHEL4, RHEL5 and RHEL6 support
 - Various usability improvements
 - Serial console support auto-detected
 - Lockless workflows
 - USB udev integration to trigger mkrescue on inserting USB device
 - Beep/UID led/USB suspend integration

== Use-cases

=== Transforming a system to use LUKS partitions
=== Recreate a system for optimal partition alignment
=== Transforming a system to move from SWRAID to HWRAID
=== Transforming a system to move from SWRAID to LVM mirroring
=== Recreate a system on a new RAID hardware backend (replace all disks to enlarge limited storage)
=== Create a single snapshot for offsite troubleshooting

== Tested configurations
During development we have tested Relax-and-Recover with the following
configurations:

 - With USB storage as rescue and Bacula backup on tape
 - With USB storage as rescue and backup on same USB storage
 - With OBDR tape as rescue and Bacula backup on separate tape
 - With OBDR tape as rescue and backup on same tape

And in the following ways:

 - Booting from second disk in SW RAID1 setup
 - Restoring to different storage configuration
 - Restoring to different hardware
 - Restoring to bad HP SmartArray config
