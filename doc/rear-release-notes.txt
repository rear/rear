Overview

Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated ReaR) is a GNU/Linux system administrator tool
and framework used to create bootable disaster recovery images which makes
bare metal disaster recovery (including backup restore) easier. System
administrators use the Relax-and-Recover framework to set up a disaster
recovery procedure as part of their disaster recovery policy (which
complements their existing backup policy). Relax-and-Recover does not
implement backup but complements it because backup (and restore) happens via
external backup software that is only called by Relax-and-Recover.

Product Features

The following features are supported by the most recent releases of
Relax-and-Recover. Anything labeled as (New) was added as the most recent
release. New functionality for previous releases can be seen in the next
chapter that details each release.

The most recent release of Relax-and-Recover is supported on most GNU/Linux
based systems with kernel 2.6 or higher. It provides the following
functionality:

-   Hot maintenance capability. A recovery/rescue image can be made online
    while the system is running

-   Command line interface. Relax-and-Recover does not require a graphical
    interface to run, neither in creation mode, nor in recovery mode (console
    is enough)

-   Support included for most common file systems, such as ext2, ext3, and
    ext4. Other filesystems like reiserfs, jfs, xfs, and btrfs are also
    implemented, but are less tested. (Feedback is appreciated)

-   Selected Hardware RAID and (eg. HP SmartArray) and mirroring solutions
    (eg. DRBD) are supported

-   NVME and mmcblk disks are supported

-   LVM root volumes are supported

-   Multipath support for SAN storage

-   UEFI support (including UEFI USB booting)

-   Integrates with internal backup programs such as:

    -   GNU tar (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar)
    -   GNU tar (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar, BACKUP_TYPE=incremental,
        FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon") for using incremental backups with a weekly full
        backup (old tar archives will not be removed automatically)
    -   GNU tar (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar, BACKUP_TYPE=differential,
        FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon") for using differential backups with a weekly full
        backup (old tar archives will not be removed automatically)
    -   GNU tar with openssl encryption (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar,
        BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED=1)
    -   rsync on local devices (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=rsync), such USB and
        local disks
    -   rsync over the network (BACKUP=RSYNC, BACKUP_PROG=rsync)
    -   Multiple backup methods. See the documentation about Using Multiple
        Backups for Relax-and-Recover
        https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc
    -   Any partition (e.g. a Windows partition) via BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE. See
        the documentation about BLOCKCLONE
        https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc
    -   BACKUP=ZYPPER is for SUSE systems only (Experimental)
    -   BACKUP=YUM is for RedHat architectures only (Experimental)

-   Integrates with external backup solutions such as:

    -   Tivoli Storage Manager (BACKUP=TSM)
    -   Data Protector (BACKUP=DP)
    -   Symantec NetBackup (BACKUP=NBU)
    -   Galaxy 5, 6, and 7 (BACKUP=GALAXY)
    -   Galaxy 10 [Commvault Simpana] (BACKUP=GALAXY10)
    -   Bacula (BACKUP=BACULA)
    -   Bareos (BACKUP=BAREOS) (A fork of Bacula)
    -   Rsync Backup Made Easy (BACKUP=RBME)
    -   Duplicity/Duply (BACKUP=DUPLICITY)
    -   EMC Networker, also known as Legato (BACKUP=NSR)
    -   EMC Avamar (BACKUP=AVA)
    -   SEP Sesam (BACKUP=SESAM)
    -   FDR/Upstream (BACKUP=FDRUPSTREAM)
    -   Novastor NovaBACKUP DC (BACKUP=NBKDC)
    -   Borg Backup (BACKUP=BORG)
    -   Rubrik Cloud Data Management (BACKUP=CDM)

-   Integrates with Disaster Recovery Linux Manager (DRLM) http://drlm.org

-   Udev support (except for some really ancient udev versions) which is the
    base for many important features:

    -   kernel drivers for network cards and storage adapters are loaded via
        udev
    -   deal with network persistent names in udev rules
    -   firmware loading
    -   persistent storage device names (though Relax-and-Recover does nothing
        with this)

-   Systemd support for the more recent Linux distributions

-   System migration and reconfiguration ('MIGRATION_MODE')

    -   facilitate recovery on hardware, that is not the same as the original
        system
    -   network and storage drivers are adjusted
    -   map hard disks if they do not match (e.g. sda -> sdb)
    -   remap network MAC addresses
    -   use another IP address, or using dhcp via templates or from kernel
        command line
    -   rebuild the initial ramdisk if needed (for new storage drivers)
    -   migration to SAN storage

-   Support backup software: Bacula, both locally attached tapes (with
    bextract) and network-based backups. Also, in combination with OBDR tapes.

-   Create OBDR tapes with method mkbackup and put the backup onto the tape to
    have a single-tape bootable recovery solution (label the OBDR tape with
    the method format to avoid accidental overwrites with OBDR)

-   Create bootable disk (eSATA, USB ...) medium with the backup included:

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/device

    Together with OUTPUT=USB we have a complete solution on hard disks
    (booting of it and restoring data).

-   DHCP client support (IPv4 and IPv6). Dhcp client activation can be forced
    via the variable USE_DHCLIENT=yes (define in /etc/rear/local.conf). It is
    also possible to force DHCP at boot time with kernel option dhcp

-   USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y, will cause statically configured network settings
    to be applied even when USE_DHCLIENT is in effect

-   Save layout and compare layouts for automation of making Relax-and-Recover
    snapshots (checklayout option)

-   External USB booting uses extlinux (instead of syslinux), and therefore,
    the USB disk must first be formatted with an ext2, ext3, ext4 or btrfs
    based file system

-   VLAN tagging, teaming and bridge support

-   Add timestamp of ReaR run with rc code to the syslog or messages file;
    sending mail report is also possible

-   The possibility to backup any partition (in particular a Windows
    partition) via the BACKUP type BLOCKCLONE

-   Unattended ReaR recovery has been improved

-   Improved security model related to SSH keys

    -   SSH_FILES='avoid_sensitive_files' (see details in
        /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)
    -   SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS='no' (see details in
        /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

NOTE: Features marked Experimental are prone to change with future releases.

Relax-and-Recover Releases

The first release of Relax-and-Recover, version 1.0, was posted to the web in
July 2006. For each release, this chapter lists the new features and defect
fixes. All releases are cumulative. Unless otherwise noted all releases of
Relax-and-Recover are intended to work backward compatible with previous
versions. In addition to the GPL disclaimer of warranty and liability there is
no guarantee that things work backward compatible. In general the older the
system is the less likely it is that a newer Relax-and-Recover version works.
For each Relax-and-Recover version upgrade and for each change of a software
that is used by Relax-and-Recover and for each change of your basic system you
must re-validate that your disaster recovery procedure still works for you.

The references pointing to fix #nr or issue #nr refer to our GitHub issues
tracker https://github.com/rear/rear/issues

Version 2.7 (July 2022)

Abstract

New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes:

-   ReaR's default TMPDIR is now /var/tmp (it was /tmp before) i.e. ReaR's
    default working area is now /var/tmp/rear.XXXXX because ReaR needs lots of
    space (from 300MB up to more than 1GB) to build the ReaR rescue/recovery
    system e.g. as ISO image and even much more space to also store the backup
    archive e.g. when the backup should be included in the ISO image. The
    system's default temporary directory /tmp is no longer suited as default
    temporary directory for ReaR because nowadays /tmp is often a "tmpfs" that
    is in RAM so /tmp has RAM/swap limitations and file-hierarchy(7)
    recommends to use /var/tmp for cases as ReaR. If the user sets TMPDIR
    explicitly, it still takes precedence.

-   Stop ReaR from possibly overwriting its own disk and backup drives for
    OUTPUT=USB and OUTPUT=RAWDISK via new WRITE_PROTECTED_... config variables
    (see /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf) where UUIDs or filesystem labels
    can be specified so that disks that contain such UUIDs or filesystem
    labels will be 'write protected' during "rear recover".

-   Added initial LUKS2 support.

-   Overhauled RAID code with changed RAID related entries in
    /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf so users who use RAID and a selfmade
    /etc/rear/disklayout.conf must adapt their RAID related entries

-   Initial preliminary basic support to automatically resize an active last
    partition on RAID0 and RAID1 disks to be able to automatically resize
    RAID0 and RAID1 arrays

-   Automatically shrink LVs if needed during "rear recover". This enables to
    run "rear recover" with automated LVM LVs shrinking as needed on a bit
    smaller replacement disk (e.g. when a nominally same sized replacement
    disk is actually a bit smaller than the original disk). This automated LVs
    shrinking is not intended when disk(s) are substantially smaller. To
    migrate onto a substantially smaller replacement disk the user must in
    advance manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear
    recover".

-   Support to wipe disks before recreating partitions/volumes/filesystems/...
    (see the new DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf). This
    is currently new and experimental functionality so that currently by
    default via DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED='false' no disk is wiped to avoid possible
    regressions until this new feature was more tested by interested users via
    an explicit DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED setting.

-   Error out when files greater or equal ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT should be
    included in the ISO: See the reasoning in
    /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf why the default ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT is
    2GiB and why we error out when files >= ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT should be
    included in the ISO.

-   Rsync OUTPUT_URLs are now properly supported with BACKUP=RSYNC.
    Previously the output went to the location specified by BACKUP_URL
    and OUTPUT_URL was ignored. One exception was OUTPUT=PXE, where the output
    was uploaded to OUTPUT_URL in addition to BACKUP_URL, but RSYNC_PREFIX was
    not respected and the interpretation of the URL was different: A URL of
    the form rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH was interpreted as using the
    rsync protocol, while in all other cases such URL would be interpreted
    as using rsync over ssh. This special handling is now removed:
    An rsync OUTPUT_URL with OUTPUT=PXE now creates the RSYNC_PREFIX directory
    at the destination and the URL is interpreted as in all other cases.

-   RAWDISK: Add local rescue partition installation capability: Introduce a
    configuration variable 'RAWDISK_INSTALL_GPT_PARTITION_NAME', which is
    unset by default. When set, the rescue system will be installed to local
    disk partitions having the corresponding name.

-   Allow setting a PBA-specific firmware configuration via the new
    OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES configuration variable.

-   Support OPAL 2 self-encrypting NVMe disk drives.

-   OPALPBA: Provide a permanent unlocking mode as a workaround when the
    firmware did not initialize properly during a 'simple' reboot so the only
    reliable way to boot was a power cycle after Opal disks were unlocked. To
    reboot with unlocked disks there is now a new unlocking mode "permanent"
    via OPAL_PBA_UNLOCK_MODE (see default.conf). Reactivating locking is then
    the responsibility of the user. Additionally enhanced security by
    disabling shell access via keyboard interrupt and switching to a password
    hash for OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD.

-   POWER architecture (ppc64) support for BACKUP=DP: Other platforms
    supporting the Data Protector Disk Agent, but not the Cell Console (GUI)
    that is only available on i386, x86_64 and ia64 are now supported with
    ReaR. This includes in particular ppc64. Checks unavailable on clients
    without the Data Protector Cell Console (GUI) are skipped. In such cases
    backup restore can be done using Data Protector GUI only.

-   NSR enhancement for point-in-time recovery with EMC Networker client: A
    new variable NSR_CLIENT_REQUESTRESTORE for the BACKUP=NSR workflow has
    been introduced to deal with situations in which the NSR client is
    allowed/granted to perform its recovery action "on its own" but does not
    have full control of the EMC networker service/environment, for details
    see its default.conf section.

-   BACKUP=NBKDC: Enhanced ReaR backup and restore to also work with NovaStor
    DataCenter 8.0 and higher plus fixed wording "NovaBACKUP DC" -> "NovaStor
    DC"

-   Support for systemd and parallel restore with Data Protector BACKUP=DP:
    Support starting Data Protector daemon 'omni.socket' via systemd in the
    recovery system. Restore performance has been increased by doing parallel
    restores now.

-   Now "rear format" has in addition to the '-efi' switch a '-bios' switch.
    If none is given (i.e. by default) it will now do hybrid formatting with a
    BIOS boot partition (on GPT) and an EFI system partition. Accordingly the
    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL default is no longer "msdos" (see the updated
    description in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf). This is a starting point
    for implementing OUTPUT=USB support for UEFI and BIOS dual boot from the
    same medium. See https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2698
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2818
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829

-   Overhauled serial console support code. A serial console of the ReaR
    recovery system can now be specified separately for the kernel and the
    recovery system bootloader via the generic config variables
    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE and SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES and specific config
    variables SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB (see /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf for
    details)

-   Support for HTTP sources when using PXE: There is a new config variable
    PXE_HTTP_URL to specify a HTTP download source for PXE. See the
    PXE_HTTP_URL description in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

-   In /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf changed ISO_VOLID from "RELAXRECOVER"
    to "REAR-ISO" so the first ISO has the label "REAR-ISO" (8 characters) and
    subsequent ISOs get the labels "REAR-ISO_01" "REAR-ISO_02" ... respectively
    that have 11 characters (the maximum length for FAT volume names) so
    things work now by default when the ISO image is used to (manually) create
    a FAT bootable USB stick Accordingly 'RELAXRECOVER' in variable names was
    replaced. In particular the user config variable for automated input
    USER_INPUT_RELAXRECOVER_SYMLINK_TARGET was renamed as
    USER_INPUT_ISO_SYMLINK_TARGET so only that new name will work.

Details (mostly in chronological order - newest topmost):

-   Refactor rsync URL support, fixes rsync OUTPUT_URL:
    The code to parse rsync:// URLs was BACKUP_URL specific.
    If one specified BACKUP=RSYNC and an OUTPUT_URL different from BACKUP_URL,
    the OUTPUT_URL was ignored and the output files went to BACKUP_URL.
    Fix by introducing generic functions for rsync URL parsing and
    use them for both BACKUP_URL and OUTPUT_URL, as appropriate.
    Replace all uses of global RSYNC_* variables derived
    from BACKUP_URL by those functions.
    There also was inconsistent special handling for OUTPUT=PXE which is now removed:
    An rsync OUTPUT_URL with OUTPUT=PXE now creates the RSYNC_PREFIX directory
    at the destination and the URL is interpreted as in all other cases.
    See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781

-   Support creation of EFI system partition on systems
    with older 'parted' that do not support the 'esp' keyword:
    In format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh try
    'sgdisk ... --typecode="partition_number:EF00"' as fallback
    when 'parted ... set partition_number esp on' failed
    see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2830

-   Set USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL to match format-workflow.sh:
    In format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh it is set
    depending on the format workflow option -b/--bios or -e/--efi
    and in in prep/USB/Linux-i386/340_find_mbr_bin.sh try to
    autodetect what the USB disk partition type is and
    use a specified USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL if autodetection fails
    see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829

-   In usr/sbin/rear enhanced the check for other simultaneously running 'rear'
    to let it find running 'rear' instances independent of how it was called by the user
    in particular also when 'rear' is run from a GitHub checkout/clone
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2826

-   In usr/share/rear/lib/format-workflow.sh do actually recognise -b/--bios
    options, see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2828

-   In layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110_include_lvm_code.sh use a fail-safe
    'yes' pipe for "lvm lvcreate" to pipe as many 'y' as asked for into
    "lvm lvcreate" see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/513
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820

-   Avoid creating a /bin/vim symlink to vi: The symlink is more confusing
    than helpful: If one has both vi and vim, and they are different
    (vi usually has less features), one expects to get the more featureful
    version by executing "vim", but one gets "vi". More importantly, in
    recent Fedora and RHEL, "vi" is a shell script that executes "vim"
    if found, so linking "vim" to "vi" leads to an infinite loop.
    See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2822

-   RPM spec: update build requirement for Fedora to unblock Packit build and
    run make validate after build, see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2816

-   In finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh explain that it is also used
    as fallback to install the nowadays most often used bootloader GRUB2
    unless the BOOTLOADER variable tells to install another bootloader (other
    bootloader install scripts check the BOOTLOADER variable),
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2817#issuecomment-1148488339

-   Replace 'RELAXRECOVER' in variable names: In lib/global-functions.sh in
    the function mount_url() renamed the user config variable for automated
    input USER_INPUT_RELAXRECOVER_SYMLINK_TARGET as
    USER_INPUT_ISO_SYMLINK_TARGET because the old name contained a user config
    value: "RELAXRECOVER" was an old default value of ISO_VOLID, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2813#discussion_r885576867

-   In default.conf properly describe PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT and POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT
    to match what the implementation does, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issuecomment-1145006984 and for
    special cases see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issuecomment-1148620157

-   Add PRE_RECOVERY_COMMANDS and POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS as alternative to
    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT and POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT see the description in
    default.conf how to use them and how they work. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2811 and see also
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735 therein in particular
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issuecomment-1134686196
    Additionally use LogPrint to show the user the executed commands, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2789

-   In default.conf describe the new user config variables USB_BOOT_PART_SIZE
    and USB_DEVICE_BOOT_LABEL see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2660

-   Exclude dev/watchdog* from the ReaR recovery system: In default.conf add
    dev/watchdog* to COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE because watchdog functionality is not
    wanted in the recovery system because we do not want any automated reboot
    functionality while disaster recovery happens via "rear recover", see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2808 Furthermore having a copy of
    dev/watchdog* during "rear mkrescue" in ReaR's build area may even trigger
    a system crash that is caused by a buggy TrendMicro ds_am module touching
    dev/watchdog in ReaR's build area (/var/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs), see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798

-   In output/default/940_grub2_rescue.sh for GRUB_RESCUE set 'root=/dev/ram0
    vga=normal rw' (the same is already done for other boot media) to avoid a
    "Kernel panic ... Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)" that could
    otherwise happen in certain cases, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2791

-   In build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh always include loaded kernel
    modules i.e. also for MODULES=() or MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )
    include the currently loaded kernel modules,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2727#issuecomment-994731345

-   In layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh ensure $disk_label is one
    of the supported partition tables (i.e. one of 'msdos' 'gpt'
    'gpt_sync_mbr' 'dasd') and ensure syntactically correct 'disk' and 'part'
    entries in disklayout.conf (each value must exist and each value must be a
    single non-blank word), see the last part about "error out directly ... when
    things failed" in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801#issuecomment-1122015129 But do
    not error out when there is no partition label type value for a 'disk'
    entry in disklayout.conf because "rear recover" works in a special case
    without partition label type value when there is only a 'disk' entry but
    nothing else for this disk exists in disklayout.conf which can happen when
    /dev/sdX is an empty SD card slot without medium, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2810

-   In default.conf explain how to use LIBS properly, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743

-   In the function find_syslinux_modules_dir in lib/bootloader-functions.sh
    the fallback 'find /usr' to find the SYSLINUX modules directory may take a
    very long time on some systems (up to several hours) so tell the user in
    debug mode what is going on, see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2792
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/624

-   In default.conf tell that MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' 'additional_module' )
    is not supported (the generic COPY_AS_IS method can be used to include
    additional modules) cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2727

-   Use disklayout.conf keyword 'raidarray' instead of 'raid' because we have
    a new 'raiddisk' keyword and a keyword must not be a leading substring of
    another keyword so we have now 'raidarray' and 'raiddisk', see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2759 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/53757eab1447c712fb7c8e44be9c8b3b3ffd9faa

-   In layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh use /[e]tc/grub.cfg
    and /[b]oot/.../grub.cfg with '*' globbing patterns (as in the EFI|GRUB2-EFI
    case) to find any of grub.cgf or grub2.cfg in /etc/ or in /boot/ (e.g. in
    openSUSE Leap 15.3 there is /boot/grub2/grub.cfg),
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796#issuecomment-1118387393

-   In default.conf added '[e]tc/crypttab' to FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795#discussion_r859670066

-   New FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS in default.conf to verify file hashes at the
    end of recover after file restore from backup and show an error when
    config files were restored from an outdated backup so the restored files
    do not match the recreated system, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787

-   In backup/RSYNC/default/450_calculate_req_space.sh comment out remote
    space check with rsync see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2760

-   In layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh and
    layout/save/default/450_check_network_files.sh added bash globbing
    characters [] around the first letter to ensure that with 'shopt -s
    nullglob' files that do not exist will not appear so nonexistent files are
    not appended to CHECK_CONFIG_FILES
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796#issuecomment-1117171070

    bootdir="/boot" that also fixes ShellCheck SC1066
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1034890880

-   New GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND in default.conf to overrule the setting in
    output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2763 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500

-   New EXCLUDE_IP_ADDRESSES and EXCLUDE_NETWORK_INTERFACES directives: These
    new array variables enable to exclude specific IP addresses or network
    interfaces when building the network configuration used in the rescue
    environment. This is typically useful when floating IP addresses are used.
    Not excluding these may lead to outage if the floating IP address is used
    by another system at time the system is getting recovered, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2736

-   multipath: fix exclusion of still wanted devices: The current code
    excluding multipath devices is broken when a device being excluded matches
    other devices. This leads to excluding wanted devices. This happens when
    having custom alias for multipath devices or there are more than 26
    multipath devices and 'mpatha' is getting excluded, which leads to
    excluding all 'mpathaX' devices are well, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2750

-   Update 06-layout-configuration.adoc: Enhance the "disk layout file syntax"
    description: Describe that one cannot rely on backward compatibility.
    Describe positional parameters vs. option=value parameters.

-   Update default.conf: In default.conf describe that when OUTPUT_URL is set
    OUTPUT_OPTIONS does not inherit the BACKUP_OPTIONS value
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2753

-   Include dmsetup and dmeventd as PROGS in conf/GNU/Linux.conf because older
    releases of os-prober (1.74 and below) use dmsetup as a fallback solution
    for mounting when grub-mount is missing but without dmsetup and dmeventd
    also in the recovery system that would block indefinitely at "Installing
    GRUB2 boot loader...", for details see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2748

-   In the function cmdline_add_console in lib/serial-functions.sh add
    'console=tty0' as fallback to cmdline only if no real serial device was
    found otherwise on a machine with e.g. ttyS0 and ttyS1 where only ttyS0 is
    real only kernel messages (but nothing else) would appear on ttyS0, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749

-   Skip unneeded /usr/lib/syslog-ng/loggen/ from recovery system: In
    conf/GNU/Linux.conf do no longer copy all in /usr/lib/syslog-ng/ but only
    copy .so files in /usr/lib/syslog-ng/ (same as for rsyslog). This skips in
    particular /usr/lib*/syslog-ng/loggen/ because 'loggen' is not included in
    the recovery system ('loggen' does not appear in any ReaR code). See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743

-   For BACKUP=CDM removed need for the whole /usr/lib64 in the recovery
    system. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2747 and the related issues
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2266
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2314
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2685
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2700

-   Update 400_copy_modules.sh: Do no longer error out if 'cp -a -L' failed to
    to copy all contents of /lib/modules/... but only tell the user about the
    issue so he could inspect his system and decide, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2739#issuecomment-1014304127

-   Support for HTTP sources when using PXE: There is a new config variable
    PXE_HTTP_URL to specify the HTTP download source for PXE. If the variable
    is set the PXE config file will generate an additional 3rd boot option
    (besides the unchanged standard options "rear" via TFTP and "local")
    namely "rear-http" which includes the HTTP URL information to download the
    kernel and initrd data. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2738

-   Also add ssh-add prog when ssh-agent is added. Since ssh-agent gets added
    it makes sense to add ssh-add as well. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2729

-   In layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh automatically
    resize active last partitions on RAID0 disks, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2696 Therefore in
    layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh a new 'raiddisk' entry that has
    same syntax as a 'disk' entry is written to disklayout.conf to have size
    (and partition label) of a RAID device like "raiddisk /dev/md127
    23599054848 gpt" because knowing the RAID device size is a precondition to
    be able to automatically resize a RAID0 array. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2730

-   In layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh automatically
    resize active last partitions on RAID1 disks and fixed fallback setting so
    that now the user can specify AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS=() in his
    local.conf. Additionally in layout/prepare/default/250_compare_disks.sh
    show info about old disk and sizes and new disks and sizes in case of
    MIGRATION_MODE to make it easier to answer the questions to which new
    disks old disk should be mapped. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2726

-   Fix modinfo_filename() in build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh Output the
    original $module_filename also when it is a symlink because in the code
    below 'cp -L' copies the symlink target content as a new regular file with
    file name as the name of the symlink so the copied content can be still
    found under its original name, cf.
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2677#issuecomment-997859219
    Additionally in case of MODULES=( 'all_modules' ) also use 'cp -L' to copy
    the actual content to avoid dangling symlinks in the recovery system. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2731

-   In usr/share/rear/output/PXE/default/800_copy_to_tftp.sh fixed pxe file cp
    and permissions for sshfs target to prevent cp error "failed to preserve
    ownership" for sshfs and to prevent issue with write permissions trying to
    override image on later runs. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2723

-   Improved wiping disks (see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2721): In
    layout/recreate/default/120_confirm_wipedisk_disks.sh skip disks that do
    not exist on the bare hardware in the recovery system
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2715 and exclude disks that are
    write-protected
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703#issuecomment-979928423 and show
    in any case a user confirmation dialog for the disks that will be wiped.
    In layout/recreate/default/150_wipe_disks.sh do no longer open (and close)
    LUKS volumes because encrypted volumes contain meaningless data unless
    opened and unencrypted so there is no need to wipe anything inside an
    encrypted LUKS container, cf. "Regarding LUKS" in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2514#issuecomment-743483945

-   Overhauled RAID code (see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2714) based on
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2702 that is about initial software RAID
    IMSM support i.e. with the changes in that pull request: Completely
    overhauled layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh: No longer a subshell
    that appends all stdout to disklayout.conf but explicit append to
    disklayout.conf where needed to be safe against accidental things written
    to disklayout.conf. Handle each mdadm option in one place i.e. parse and
    prepare output. Handle options ordered by importance, mandatory first,
    then optional ones. Basic tests that mandatory options are syntactically
    valid plus Error if not. Overhauled
    layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/120_include_raid_code.sh: The FEATURE_MDADM_UUID
    code is meanwhile obsolete because all mdadm versions in supported ReaR
    Linux distributions support '-uuid'. New
    layout/recreate/default/220_verify_layout.sh to verify if RAID devices are
    recreated with the UUIDs in disklayout.conf because mdadm silently ignores
    this option when creating IMSM arrays (both containers and the volumes
    inside them) and picks a random UUID
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2702#issuecomment-970395567 Support
    user specified DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED to mitigate
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2715 see the DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED
    description in default.conf

-   Update 100_create_layout_file.sh: Additionally show the filesystem LABEL
    in the 'lsblk' output of the original system as comment in disklayout.conf
    to make it easier to understand subsequent data in particular for RAID
    where the array name is shown as LABEL in 'lsblk' for example like
    "/dev/sda ... linux_raid_member any:raid1sdab" - see also "one cannot see ...
    /dev/md/ symlinks as NAME ... /dev/md/raid1sdab -> ../md127" in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2702#issuecomment-951769031 and see also
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1a8a88c20d01f01fac65e296e9481ab9172c3ac7

-   Update 100_create_layout_file.sh: Additionally show UUID in 'lsblk' output
    of the original system as comment in disklayout.conf to make it easier to
    compare UUIDs of the original system with what was recreated, cf. "...
    shouldn't it [ReaR] restore the [RAID] arrays with the same UUIDs ...?" in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2702#issuecomment-968904230 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2714#issuecomment-970279152

-   Update 050_start_required_nfs_daemons.sh: Start rpcbind with the -s option
    to avoid that in some cases rpcbind is not started / not available in the
    recovery system cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2672

-   New function is_multipath_used in layout-functions.sh (see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2708) to get 'multipath -l' out of the
    function is_multipath_path by adding a separated function
    is_multipath_used that runs 'multipath -l' (which is expensive because it
    scans all devices) to check if multipath is used and remembers the result
    in MULTIPATH_IS_USED that is used in subsequent calls of is_multipath_used
    (without calling 'multipath -l') so we can call is_multipath_used many
    times via is_multipath_path which is called in
    layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh for each disk device. This
    should avoid long computing time when there are very may disk devices,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814950019

-   Now "rear format" has in addition to the -efi switch a -bios switch. If
    none is given (i.e. by default) it will now do hybrid formatting with a
    BIOS boot partition (on GPT) and an EFI system partition. This is a
    starting point for implementing OUTPUT=USB support for UEFI and BIOS dual
    boot from the same medium see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2698 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2705

-   Update write-protect-functions.sh: In the function
    is_write_protected_by_id() assume a disk without any of UUID PTUUID
    PARTUUID WWN is empty and meant to be used to recreate the system so it
    should not be write-protected
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703#discussion_r757393547

-   Enhanced disk write-protection, see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2626 by WRITE_PROTECTED_IDS with
    generic functionality,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2626#issuecomment-950953826 together
    with the new WRITE_PROTECTED_ID_TYPES which defaults to UUID PTUUID
    PARTUUID WWN so that the user can specify different lsblk columns as
    needed in his particular environment
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703#issuecomment-962418441

-   Stop ReaR from overwriting its own disk and backup drives for OUTPUT=USB
    and OUTPUT=RAWDISK via new WRITE_PROTECTED_... config variables (see
    default.conf) where UUIDs or filesystem labels can be specified so that
    disks that contain such UUIDs or filesystem labels will be 'write
    protected' during "rear recover", see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2626

-   Overhauled serial console support code. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2699 A serial console of the ReaR
    recovery system can now be specified separately for the kernel and the
    recovery system bootloader via the generic config variables
    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE and SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES and specific config
    variables SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf for
    details cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2663 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2697

-   More control over serial devices used for console. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2697

-   In layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh overhauled the automapping of
    original 'disk' devices and 'multipath' devices to current block devices
    in the currently running recovery system so that now it automatically
    finds an existing unique disk size mapping also when there is a unique
    mapping between more than two disks, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2690

-   Fix multiple VG recreation, see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2691 Do
    not use global variables in diskrestore.sh: Fix a problem introduced in
    commits b184194f37dd22a7e55655ff388579297239e73c and
    311bfb3da1d5e47a2ff144123a2457e634f67893 (PR #1806) that shows up when
    there are multiple VGs to restore. Using variables
    create_thin_volumes_only and create_logical_volumes to propagate
    information from VG creation to LV creation does not work well in the case
    of multiple VGs, because the variables are global and if there are
    multiple VGs, their values will leak from one VG to another. The generated
    diskrestore.sh script does not guarantee that the LVs of a given VG are
    created immediately after their VG and before creating another VG.
    Currently, the script first creates all VGs and then all LVs, so all the
    LVs in all VGs will see the value of create_logical_volumes and
    create_thin_volumes_only from the last VG, not from their own. This
    matters when different VGs behave differently (typically if one has a thin
    pool and the other does not). Fix by replacing the scalar values by arrays
    of VG names. If a given VG is in the array, it is the equivalent of the
    former scalar value being 1 for the given VG, if it is not in the array,
    it is an equivalent of a former value of 0. For the create_volume_group
    variable the change is not needed, but do it nevertheless for symmetry
    with other variables.

-   Error out in sbin/rear when it failed to source or Source() mandatory
    files to make it obvious when there are syntax errors in user config files
    and/or when there are syntax errors in our lib/*-functions.sh code, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2686

-   Overhauled output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh In particular no
    longer use "cp -p" because '-p' may fail because it copies to a VFAT
    filesystem on the EFI partition see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2683 and now always use "cp -L" to
    ensure the real content gets copied. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2684

-   Overhauled the description in user-guide/05-integration.adoc what "rear
    savelayout" and "rear checklayout" are meant to do, cf.
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7a3884bed1fb6cb61654c4e266ba4c35094bd9f4#r56879062

-   Fixed https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667 "rear does not entirely
    remove build area any more" by using double quotes for
    remove_temporary_mountpoint "$BUILD_DIR/..." and fixed
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676 "False ERROR '.../outputfs not
    empty, cannot remove' when OUTPUT_URL is unset" by making
    scheme_supports_filesystem() fail-safe if $1 is empty or blank and also
    making scheme_accepts_files() fail-safe in the same way, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2675

-   On POWER require bootlist & ofpathname if needed: The ofpathname binary is
    called by grub2-install. Therefore, it is required in the rescue system in
    order to make the recovered system bootable, except for the PowerNV (Not
    Virtualized - bare metal) case. Under PowerVM, we also need the bootlist
    executable to make the system bootable. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2665

-   ReaR's default TMPDIR is now /var/tmp (it was /tmp before) i.e. ReaR's
    default working area is now /var/tmp/rear.XXXXX ReaR needs lots of space
    (from 300MB up to more than 1GB) to build the ReaR rescue/recovery system
    e.g. as ISO image and even much more space to also store the backup
    archive e.g. when the backup should be included in the ISO image. The
    system's default temporary directory /tmp is no longer suited as default
    temporary directory for ReaR because nowadays /tmp is often a "tmpfs" that
    is in RAM so /tmp has RAM/swap limitations. file-hierarchy(7) recommends
    to use /var/tmp for such cases. If the user sets TMPDIR explicitly, it
    still takes precedence. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2664

-   Cleanup of GRUB2 config code in particular for OUTPUT=USB: Cleanup of the
    create_grub2_cfg function: Describe its usage in a comment. Have its
    helper functions inside create_grub2_cfg to make them not globally
    accessible. Initial steps to clean up how the GRUB root device is set via
    one single method. DebugPrint output how GRUB2 is configured to help the
    user to find errors or bugs. Better GRUB2 menu entry names. Consistent
    calling of the create_grub2_cfg function always as create_grub2_cfg
    "/path/to/kernel" "/path/to/initrd" >/path/to/grub.cfg also in
    output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh. Set GRUB2 timeout to new
    config variable GRUB2_TIMEOUT that is by default 300 seconds. Set GRUB2
    default boot menu entry to GRUB2_DEFAULT_BOOT that is by default
    'chainloader' which should usually boot the original system and reference
    GRUB2 boot menu entries by 'menuentry ... -id=...' to have meaningful names
    instead of meaningless numbers. Sleep 3 seconds exactly before GRUB2 shows
    its menu (it replaces what there is on the screen) so that the user could
    see possible GRUB2 (error) messages on the screen. Additionally cleanup of
    the get_root_disk_UUID function. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662

-   Fixed serial console for syslinux: It writes only one serial line matching
    the configured device (when found) to the config. It also writes it for
    the syslinux config in case it is used without extlinux. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2650

-   Fix function create_grub2_cfg() for the none EFI cases and adds serial
    console configuration to the GRUB2 config. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2661

-   Simplifications for USB_BOOTLOADER="grub" and choose the right GRUB2
    config /boot/grub/grub.cfg or /boot/grub2/grub.cfg see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2659

-   Cleanup USB format scripts and related code: Now OUTPUT=USB should behave
    sufficiently OK on BIOS systems with syslinux/extlinux as bootloader with
    a separated boot partition and without it (still the default). To use
    OUTPUT=USB on BIOS with syslinux/extlinux with a separated boot partition
    size of e.g. 1024 MiB specify in etc/rear/local.conf something like
    OUTPUT=USB USB_BOOT_PART_SIZE=1024
    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REARBOOT BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2660

-   Fixed format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh for none EFI cases by
    adding a BIOS boot partition and setting the 'legacy_boot' flag in case of
    GPT partitioning. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2656

-   Added support for GRUB2 as bootloader for OUTPUT=USB via new config
    variable USB_BOOTLOADER=grub see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2655

-   With the new default USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS=0 input is not truncated and it
    also makes correcting the input possible (before [Enter] is pressed) see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2622

-   Update default.conf: Since https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633 export
    TMPDIR="..." in ReaR config files like etc/rear/local.conf does no longer
    work so now export TMPDIR="..." must be called before calling 'rear'
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2654

-   Treat RAID layout value '-unknown-' same as an empty value: In
    layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh treat the RAID layout value
    '-unknown-' same as an empty value to avoid that
    layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/120_include_raid_code.sh will create a 'mdadm'
    command in diskrestore.sh like "mdadm ... -layout=-unknown- ..." which would
    fail during "rear recover" with something like "mdadm: layout -unknown-
    not understood for raid0", see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2616

-   Avoid false Error() exit in copy_binaries() in
    build/GNU/Linux/390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh by skipping 'cp' errors in
    copy_binaries() (regardless what the reason was why 'cp' failed) but then
    add the affected binary to REQUIRED_PROGS to verify later that the binary
    actually exists in the recovery system which should be still sufficient to
    let ReaR error out if something actually went wrong with needed binaries.
    See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2643

-   NSR enhancement for point-in-time recovery with EMC Networker client: A
    new variable NSR_CLIENT_REQUESTRESTORE for the BACKUP=NSR workflow has
    been introduced to deal with situations in which the NSR client is
    allowed/granted to perform its recovery action "on its own" but does not
    have full control of the EMC networker service/environment, for details
    see its default.conf section. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2641

-   Workaround against DRBD9 restore error "refusing to be primary while peer
    is not outdated" see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2634

-   Cleanup rsync and fix error reporting: See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2632 Cleanups of rsync code to use
    better variable names and local variables, stop using StopIfError, use
    better redirections etc. Fixed a problem with rsync error detection that
    caused rsync errors during backup restore to be ignored, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2612 Now a warning is displayed and if
    BACKUP_INTEGRITY_CHECK is true, it is elevated to an error and ReaR
    aborts. Furthermore check fake super support only when RSYNC_PROTO=ssh and
    removed a broken test for -fake-super arg to rsync, cf.
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2577

-   Show some stdout and stderr messages also in non-debug modes: In non-debug
    modes (in particular also in verbose mode) stdout and stderr are
    redirected to a temporary file
    STDOUT_STDERR_FILE=TMP_DIR/rear.WORKFLOW.stdout_stderr so in non-debug
    modes stdout and stderr of all programs is still available for the Error()
    function to extract some latest messages that get shown on the usrer's
    terminal and those extracted lines are also copied into the log
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2623 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498 Furthermore the log files and the
    stdout/stderr file can now only be read by root. Additionally when there
    is something still mounted within the build area when rear finishes, the
    user is informed what is mounted and that he must manually umount it
    before he can (also manually) remove the build area. Finally the Error()
    and cleanup_build_area_and_end_program() functions are made fail-safe
    against not yet existing log files and not yet sourced other functions in
    case of early Error() exits in usr/sbin/rear see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633

-   Fixed accidental destructive backup removal in exit task and cleanup
    handling of URL mountpoints: See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2625
    Cleanup of temporary mount point handling, particularly for output.
    Unification of mount point umount and cleanup move to the mount_url() and
    umount_url() functions. Replaced the various "rm -rf" of the mountpoint by
    "rmdir" which fixes https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611 Added lazy
    umount in case normal umount does not succeed. If build dir is kept
    (cf. KEEP_BUILD_DIR), propose a safe way to remove it to the user via "rm
    -Rf -one-file-system" instead of just "rm -Rf" where the user risks to
    remove everything below that mountpoint if still mounted. Fixes also some
    other bugs noted in the process: Filesystem-specific umount command not
    called
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/20359a987662cc0c3fcfa52d62d1feac7cd55850#r51319634
    Unknown schemes considered invalid, see the discussion under
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/932 Identical scripts under DUPLICITY
    and YUM replaced by symlinks. Reverted
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/782 that had reintroduced
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/465 which got re-reported as
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611 Reverted
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/578 because it is not clear how
    .lockfile can exist in the unmounted filesystem, and if it does, it is a
    bug. Reverted
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d850c4094238a03c9b926b88d7e1582ecd28af52
    because it became meanwhile obsoleted by
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a8fdc445d0d6f7f9184dc6633817928f96aae9bc

-   Add BACKUP_DUPLICITY_OPTIONS to
    restore/DUPLICITY/default/400_restore_duplicity.sh Additional
    BACKUP_DUPLICITY_OPTIONS options were missing which can cause the recover
    to fail (options may contain endpoint information for example), see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2619

-   In prep/default/400_save_directories.sh also exclude mountpoints that are
    below mountpoints of "type autofs": Those are below an ancestor mountpoint
    that is owned/created by the automounter. It is possible to create a
    sub-mountpoint below an automounted mountpoint but the fact that the
    sub-mountpoint is not local means it should be excluded (i.e. there is no
    need to recreate the non-local sub-mountpoint directory), see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2610

-   Better description and error checking for GRUB_RESCUE with UEFI plus some
    alignment with the create_grub2_cfg function,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2545 Better describe GRUB_RESCUE
    with UEFI in default.conf and in output/default/940_grub2_rescue.sh better
    error checking plus some alignment with how create_grub2_cfg() creates a
    GRUB2 config file i.e. no longer "insmod" the GRUB2 modules efi_gop
    efi_uga video_bochs video_cirrus
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2609#issuecomment-831883795 and the
    discussion in https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2388 see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2609

-   Fix setting boot path in case of UEFI partition (ESP) on MD RAID: The code
    finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh did not support Software RAID.
    It has to execute the efibootmgr command on the members of the Software
    RAID, see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2595 The ESP may be located
    on a RAID device. In this case, we need to determine the physical RAID
    components and call efibootmgr on them. In addition, clean up
    finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh and add more logging to ease
    analysis when something goes wrong, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2608

-   In prep/RSYNC/default/050_prep_rsync.sh adding sleep period to give rsync
    daemon time to wake up, see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2599

-   Have unused LVM PV devices only as comment in disklayout.conf: PVs that
    are not part of a VG are documented as comment in disklayout.conf but they
    are not recreated because they were not used on the original system so
    there is no need to recreate them by "rear recover" see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2596 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2603

-   Automatically shrink LVs if needed during "rear recover". This enables to
    run "rear recover" with automated LVM LVs shrinking as needed on a bit
    smaller replacement disk (e.g. when a nominally same sized replacement
    disk is actually a bit smaller than the original disk). This automated LVs
    shrinking is not intended when disk(s) are substantially smaller. To
    migrate onto a substantially smaller replacement disk the user must in
    advance manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear
    recover". In layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110_include_lvm_code.sh assume the
    command "lvcreate -L 123456b -n LV VG" had failed because of "Volume group
    ... has insufficient free space" and then try as fallback attempt using all
    remaining free space in the VG via "lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n LV VG". In
    layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh sort the 'lvs' output lines by
    size of the LVs so only some biggest LVs may get automatically shrunk
    (if needed) because we assume that the data of the backup can still be
    restored into a big LV after it was shrunk a bit. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2591

-   Replaced possibly misleading "USB device" by generic "USB or disk device"
    wording in user messages (e.g. when a built-in disk /dev/sdc is used that
    is no USB device). The word "USB" indicates that those messages belong to
    the OUTPUT=USB method,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2589#issuecomment-805649510 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2588 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2589

-   Wipe disks before recreating partitions/volumes/filesystems/... see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799 See the new DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED in
    default.conf and for details see
    usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/README.wipe_disks This is currently
    new and experimental functionality so that currently by default via
    DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED='false' no disk is wiped to avoid possible regressions
    until this new feature was more tested by interested users via an explicit
    DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED setting in local.conf see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2514

-   In etc/scripts/system-setup.d/41-load-special-modules.sh load the nvram
    kernel module if possible to make /dev/nvram appear because /dev/nvram
    should be there when installing GRUB, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2554 and include the nvram kernel
    module in the recovery system because nvram could be a module in
    particular on POWER architecture see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2554#issuecomment-764720180 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2580

-   Make 400_copy_modules.sh fail-safe for newer modinfo output (in particular
    modinfo in kmod-27 since SLES15-SP3) because otherwise copying builtin
    kernel "modules" would let "rear mkrescue" error out with e.g. "ERROR:
    unix exists but no module file?". Furthermore ensure that kernel modules
    that should be loaded during recovery system startup (i.e. those in
    MODULES_LOAD) get always copied into the recovery system. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2579

-   In 300_format_usb_disk.sh adapt USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE fallback value to 512
    to be in compliance with the new default.conf setting of 512 MiB since
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9a6b9a109aa77afc6c96cf05bbd7988cf0310d61
    that was done in relation to https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576 see
    also https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2602

-   Do not specify '-F 16' for mkfs.vfat and also no '-o fat=16' when mounting
    it but rely on the mkfs.vfat automatic FAT type selection (which is FAT16
    up to 511 MiB and FAT32 starting at 512 MiB at least on openSUSE Leap 15.2
    with mkfs.vfat from dosfstools-4.1) and rely on the automatic FAT type
    detection when mounting, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2575 and
    increase the default ESP size to USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="512" to get by
    default (via mkfs.vfat) a FAT32 ESP to be in compliance that "the ESP
    should officially use a FAT32 filesystem" to avoid possible FAT16 ESP
    issues with certain UEFI firmware. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576

-   Update 230_filesystem_layout.sh: Increase the 'docker info' timeout value
    from 5 seconds to 10 seconds because sometimes 'docker info' needs more
    than 5 seconds to finish,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2572#issuecomment-784110872

-   Support loop devices in format_usb_disk see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2555

-   Update 110_include_lvm_code.sh: Make sure we delete the volume group
    before re-creating it. The issue happens in Migration mode when ReaR is
    not trying to use vgcfgrestore. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2564

-   In usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh add 2
    more 32MiB blocks to be on the safe side against inexplicable failures
    like "cp: error writing
    '/tmp/rear.XXX/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/elilo.conf': No space left on
    device" where the above calculated $efi_img_sz is a bit too small in
    practice, see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2552

-   Add terminal password check via 'TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD' and describe it in
    default.conf, see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539

-   Changes for NetBackup (NBU) support: Copy NetBackup PBX related files to
    the rescue system and start vxpbx_exchanged on boot. Add /usr/openv/tmp
    directory to the NBU skeleton. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2544

-   RAWDISK: Add local rescue partition installation capability: Introduce a
    configuration variable 'RAWDISK_INSTALL_GPT_PARTITION_NAME', which is
    unset by default. When set, the rescue system will be installed to local
    disk partitions having the corresponding name. RAWDISK: fix local rescue
    partition installs (unmount before copying): While the recently created
    EFI boot partition is still mounted, its file system might not be fully
    synced. Unmounting ensures that the underlying loop block device is up to
    date before possibly being copied to local disk partitions. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2538

-   BACKUP=BACULA: Make bacula aware of different location of config files see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2535

-   In layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/131_include_filesystem_code.sh fixed vfat mkfs
    using uuid from layout if possible see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2546

-   Completely overhauled USB filesystem kernel module handling: In
    prep/USB/default/380_copy_usb_fs_module.sh do no longer unconditionally
    add the USB filesystem to the MODULES and MODULES_LOAD arrays because
    there are systems where the USB filesystem (e.g. 'ext3') is no kernel
    module and then (via MODULES_LOAD and /etc/modules) "modprobe ext3" would
    fail in 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh with a false alarm "modprobe:
    FATAL: ... ext3 not found ..." message that would appear on the user's
    terminal during recovery system startup. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2537

-   Add DP_LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include shared libraries used by BACKUP=DP see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2549

-   POWER architecture (ppc64) support for BACKUP=DP: Other platforms
    supporting the Data Protector Disk Agent, but not the Cell Console (GUI)
    that is only available on i386, x86_64 and ia64 are now supported with
    ReaR. This includes in particular ppc64. Checks unavailable on clients
    without the Data Protector Cell Console (GUI) are skipped. In such cases
    backup restore can be done using Data Protector GUI only.

-   BACKUP=NBKDC: Enhanced ReaR backup and restore to also work with NovaStor
    DataCenter 8.0 and higher plus fixed wording "NovaBACKUP DC" -> "NovaStor
    DC", see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2518

-   Provide final power to the user to skip the ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT test: Skip
    the assert_ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT function when there is no usable
    ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT set so the user could specify ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=0 in
    his etc/rear/local.conf if he wants to skip the ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT test.
    Additionally enforce maximum 2GiB ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT when the MODULES
    array contains 'loaded_modules' because MODULES+=( udf ) has no effect in
    this case unless it is loaded (which normally isn't).

-   Error out when files greater or equal ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT should be
    included in the ISO: See the reasoning in default.conf why the default
    ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT is 2GiB and why we error out when files >=
    ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT should be included in the ISO. It is needed to avoid
    possibly disastrous failures later during "rear recover" that users who
    exceed that limit in exceptional cases get a hard (error) info to
    thoroughly test and verify whether or not things actually work for them.
    See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2525

-   Completely overhauled ldd test in 990_verify_rootfs.sh: Now if needed a
    special LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set only in the bash that runs ldd and that
    bash exits after ldd finished so the special LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting is
    gone with it. So there is no need to remember and restore some previously
    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH because nothing was changed in the bash that runs
    rear. Furthermore reporting when a binary requires additional libraries
    happens now in the same 'for' loop after the ldd test was run which
    further simplifies the code. See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523

-   Skip the ldd test for ReaR files: In build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh
    skip the ldd test for ReaR files (mainly bash scripts) where it does not
    make sense, cf.
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519#issuecomment-731196820

-   In 500_clone_keyboard_mappings.sh have more neutral wording in messages
    about possible keyboard issues and don't be needlessly verbose: It seems
    newer Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) no longer contain any
    keymaps directory as part of the base system by default so including
    multi-keyboard support into the recovery system is impossible there. If
    the distro provides console-multi-keyboard support, ReaR includes it
    (without being verbose). If the distro has decided that this is not
    necessary, ReaR aligns with it (without being verbose). If the user has
    installed multi-keyboard support, ReaR aligns with it (without being
    verbose). Only when including the current keyboard mapping failed
    (i.e. when 'dumpkeys' failed) it shows subsequent messages on the user's
    terminal in any case. See https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2520

-   Restore LD_LIBRARY_PATH after reporting binaries with 'not found'
    libraries: In build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh restore the
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH after reporting binaries with 'not found' shared object
    dependencies so that results are the same for the first 'ldd' run that
    finds binaries with 'not found' shared objects dependencies and the second
    'ldd' run that reports those 'not found' shared objects dependencies, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2508#issuecomment-725914211

-   Improved TCG Opal 2 documentation doc/user-guide/13-tcg-opal-support.adoc

    installation according to the suggestion in

    Additionally some information from an article on Ask Ubuntu are included
    https://askubuntu.com/a/1271171/1120528

-   Make recreating LUKS volumes work with optional cryptsetup options: The
    "cryptseup luksFormat" command does not require any of the type, cipher,
    key-size, hash, uuid option values because if omitted a cryptseup default
    value is used, cf.
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2504#issuecomment-720341023 The right
    UUID values are mandatory for LUKS volumes that will be mounted during
    startup of the recreated system. But this does not mean ReaR should error
    out when there is no cryptsetup uuid value because it is possible to run
    "rear recover" with enforced MIGRATION_MODE and manually correct the
    restored /mnt/local/etc/crypttab file to use the new UUIDs before the
    initrd is recreated and the bootloader is (re)-installed
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2509

-   Allow setting a PBA-specific firmware configuration via the new
    OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES configuration variable. Add '.../amdgpu/*' firmware
    files for AMD graphics hardware (if present) on TCG Opal pre-boot
    authentication (PBA) images, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2474

-   Support OPAL 2 self-encrypting NVMe disk drives: Normally the OPAL device
    itself is used directly but NVMe devices have one or more namespaces per
    primary device and these namespaces act as disks,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475

-   Added initial LUKS2 support, see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2204
    Added new parameter 'type' to 'crypt' keyword used in disklayout.conf.
    Using this parameter allows to recreate the same version of LUKS as on the
    original system. Added LUKS version detection, parsing depending on
    version and usage of 'type' parameter.

-   New 036_valid_output_methods.sh to error out for unsupported OUTPUT
    methods: For "rear mkbackup/mkrescue/mkbackuponly/mkopalpba" (i.e. for all
    workflows that run the 'prep' stage) check that the OUTPUT method is
    actually implemented i.e. check that a usr/share/rear/output/$OUTPUT
    directory exists and error out when an OUTPUT method seems to be not
    supported to ensure that the user cannot specify a non-working OUTPUT in
    etc/rear/local.conf
    (cf. usr/share/rear/prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh) see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2501

-   Redirect stdout and stderr to the log only in debug modes. In normal modes
    stdout and stderr are discarded (go now to /dev/null). The reason is to
    get rid of messages from command stdout and stderr that don't make sense
    for the user on their own unless there is more information in the log that
    provides context about the called command (e.g. what exact command was
    called in debugscript mode) see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498

-   More verbose messages when components are excluded so that is is easier
    for the user to see directly on his terminal what the actual results are
    when he specified to exclude components in his etc/rear/local.conf and
    what components are automatically excluded by ReaR. The verbosity depends
    on if ReaR is run in verbose '-v' mode or even in debug '-d' or '-D' mode.

-   Inform the user about unsupported LUKS2 volumes but do not error out see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2491 plus some general code cleanup
    and improvements in layout/save/GNU/Linux/260_crypt_layout.sh

-   Update 05-integration.adoc: Explain that error messages in ReaR's log may
    not come from ReaR itself but from programs that are called by ReaR
    because stdout and stderr are redirected into ReaR's log file,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2479

-   Have 'cd WORKING_DIR' in Source() function: Ensure that after each sourced
    file we are back in ReaR's usual working directory which is the current
    working directory when usr/sbin/rear is launched that is also the working
    directory of all the other scripts and config files that get sourced via
    the Source() function in lib/framework-functions.sh see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2461

-   In 400_copy_modules.sh skip copying kernel modules that are builtin
    modules. The new behaviour is that when modules are listed in
    modules.builtin and are also shown by modinfo then those modules are now
    skipped. Before for such modules the modules file(s) would have been
    included in the recovery system. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2414

-   In backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh filter purely informational tar
    messages from output: Suppress purely informational tar messages from
    output like "tar: Removing leading / from member names" or "tar: Removing
    leading / from hard link targets" or "tar: /path/to/socket: socket
    ignored" but keep actual tar error or warning messages like "tar:
    /path/to/file: file changed as we read it" and show only messages that are
    prefixed with the name of the failed program (like 'tar:' or 'dd:') which
    works when tar or dd fail but falsely suppresses messages from openssl
    which needs to be fixed later,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2466#discussion_r466347471

-   Fixed exit code logic in backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh: Commit
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2674807f6ad48da80b193ae977d345ad2ef5fdd1
    removed the BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_OPTIONS="cat" dummy code which broke the
    exit code logic because pipes_rc and backup_prog_shortnames did no longer
    match. Additionally ensure that the number of elements in both arrays are
    always the same.

-   Use ReaR specific TMP_DIR (not TMPDIR or hardcoded /tmp) plus some general
    cleanup work as noticed "by the way" in scripts, see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2460 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2462

-   Adaptions and enhancements for BACKUP=CDM because the RBS agent file name
    changed in Rubrik CDM v5.1 from rubrik-agent-sunos5.10.sparc.tar.gz to
    rubrik-agent-solaris.sparc.tar.gz see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2441

-   Let 'dd' read and write up to 1M=1024*1024 bytes at a time to speed up
    things cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2369 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2458

-   In default.conf change ISO_VOLID from "RELAXRECOVER" to "REAR-ISO" so the
    first ISO has the label "REAR-ISO" (8 characters) and subsequent ISOs get
    the labels "REAR-ISO_01" "REAR-ISO_02" ... respectively that have 11
    characters (the maximum length for FAT volume names) so things work now by
    default when the ISO image is used to (manually) create a FAT bootable USB
    stick, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2456

-   OPALPBA: Provide a permanent unlocking mode as a workaround because
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2426 did not resolve the issue
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2425 where for an HPE ML10Gen9 server
    it seems the firmware did not initialize properly during a 'simple' reboot
    so the only reliable way to boot was a power cycle after Opal disks were
    unlocked. To reboot with unlocked disks there is now a new unlocking mode
    "permanent" via OPAL_PBA_UNLOCK_MODE (see default.conf). Reactivating
    locking is then the responsibility of the user. Additionally enhanced
    security by disabling shell access via keyboard interrupt and switching to
    a password hash for OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD.

-   Use single quotes in the password settings examples because single quotes
    avoid issues with the special bash characters like $ in the password,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2178

-   Update format-workflow.sh: For "rear format" show "Use 'rear format -
    -help' for more information" also when a "rear format" argument is not
    accepted to help the user what the right syntax is (e.g. "rear format
    help" and "rear format - help" do not work, only "rear format - -help"
    works) and provide a more helpful example "rear -v format - -efi /dev/sdX"
    that is actually needed for UEFI.

-   Support for systemd and parallel restore with Data Protector BACKUP=DP:
    Support starting Data Protector daemon 'omni.socket' via systemd in the
    recovery system. Restore performance has been increased by doing parallel
    restores now. Additional new script
    usr/share/rear/finalize/DP/default/500_restore_ssc.sh to restore the
    client certificate when Data Protector Secure Communication is used. Plus
    several general script cleanup things. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2443

-   Supply default value for root in grub in UEFI ISO: Sometimes the search
    command in GRUB2 used in UEFI ISO does not find the root device. This was
    seen at least in Debian Buster running in Qemu (VirtualBox works fine,
    RHEL/CentOS in Qemu works fine as well). To make ReaR work in this case,
    set $root to a sensible value before trying search. The GRUB2 image
    created by grub-mkstandalone has $root set to memdisk, which can't work.
    This essentially matches how it used to work before
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2293 and fixes
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2434

-   Update 300_format_usb_disk.sh: In
    format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh when prompting user for size of
    EFI system partition on USB disk if no valid value is specified also use
    400 MiB as default (same as the default value in default.conf)
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1205#issuecomment-433336977 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/89e6a47c82fbfe8d059a4647755f94750fe28acc

-   Replaced $DATE usage with consistent variables START_SECONDS
    START_DATE_TIME_NUMBER and START_DATE_TIME_STRING see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2452

-   Various TCG Opal Improvements: OPALPBA, Ubuntu: Fix incomplete file
    exclusions: Fixes omissions reported in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2436 Uses COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE where
    possible. Removes files from the PBA system's staging directory where not
    copying could not be configured. OPALPBA: Improve boot splash on Ubuntu
    20.04: Takes into account a change from VT1 to VT7 to hide log messages
    during the boot process. Improves Plymouth boot splash usage to hide log
    messages during the reboot after unlocking disks. opaladmin: Add
    sub-commands 'deactivate', 'reactivate': Makes turning on and off hardware
    encryption easier on provisioned drives. TCG Opal-2: simplify quoting in
    messages and replace 'StopIfError' use
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/daf35e235d0770c663ff8dba866dddec76586a27
    Explicitly issuing an unlock command before reactivating locking ensures
    that the device remains in an unlocked state when locking is reactivated.

-   Add an explanatory comment in lib/_input-output-functions.sh that using
    the ...IfError functions can result unexpected behaviour in certain cases
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2443#pullrequestreview-440609407 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/534 and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1415#issuecomment-315692391

-   Migrate XFS configuration files. When in MIGRATION_MODE, migrate/rename
    XFS configuration files so they follow disk mapping set by user. See
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2333

Version 2.6 (June 2020)

Abstract

New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes:

-   Initial preliminary first basic support for IBM Z architecture "s390x"
    (a.k.a. "z Systems", formerly "System/390", simply called "s390"):
    Currently primarily for Red Hat and SUSE enterprise systems so that
    interested users can try out early how far things work in their particular
    IBM Z environments and provide feedback preferably plus needed fixes,
    adaptions, and enhancements to ReaR upstream at
    https://github.com/rear/rear (issues #2137 #2142).

-   New BACKUP=CDM method to support Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM): The
    Rubrik CDM backup and restore method for ReaR allows Rubrik CDM to perform
    bare metal recovery of Linux systems. It does this by including the Rubrik
    CDM RBS agent files in the ReaR recovery system so that during
    rear recover the Rubrik CDM RBS agent can be used to restore from Rubrik
    CDM (issue #2248).

-   New use-case for BLOCKCLONE backup method with the "multiple backups"
    approach for a more complex LUKS setup with different passphrases or keys:
    The usual support for LUKS-encrypted filesystems means that during
    reare recover a new encrypted filesystem will be created with new
    encryption keys. To recover the exact LUKS setup including its keys from
    the original system it is now possible to use the "multiple backups"
    approach by first ignoring the encrypted filesystem during the "base
    system" phase, and then using a second BLOCKCLONE phase with a dd image
    that contains the encrypted filesystem. The new config variable
    BLOCKCLONE_TRY_UNMOUNT is needed here: It will try to unmount the
    encrypted filesystem before creating its image and before restoring it
    (issue #2200).

-   Initial draft implementation of the new 'mountonly' workflow to use ReaR
    as rescue system, therein mount the filesystems of the target system so
    that one can manually repair it. This is described in
    doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc (issue #2247).

-   Enable creation of non consecutive partitions. parted is not capable of
    creating non-consecutive partitions. To still be able to do so, the trick
    consists in creating dummy partitions to fill the gaps between partition
    numbers. Allocation of these dummy partitions is done from the end of the
    target partition, because parted is not capable of resizing a partition
    from the beginning (issues #2081 #1793 #1771 #1681).

-   Improved handling of partition label type for multipath disks plus
    including of multipath disks in backup (unless AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH is
    true). Now the partition label type for multipath devices (same as is
    already done for normal disks) is stored in 'multipath' entries in
    disklayout.conf so that the syntax of those entries changed and that new
    syntax is now documented in doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc
    (issues #2234 #2236).

-   The config variable WAIT_SECS default value was aligned with the
    USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT default value so that now the default timeout for user
    input is always 300 seconds. The former WAIT_SECS default value of 30
    seconds was too short because the 'read -t' timeout interrupts ongoing
    user input. The timeout must be sufficiently long for the user to read and
    understand the possibly unexpected user input request message and then
    some more time to make a decision what to enter and finally even more time
    to enter the right value (issue #2257).

-   Enhanced default AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp ) to
    automatically exclude temporarily mounted things (e.g. USB devices)
    because mountpoints for temporarily mounted things are usually
    sub-directories below /media /run (like /run/media) /mnt and /tmp (issue
    #2239).

-   Now we have CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="true" by default. See the explanation
    in default.conf what that means. (issue #2345)

-   Replaced grub-mkimage with more sophisticated grub-mkstandalone when
    building GRUB2 image for using GRUB2 as recovery system UEFI bootloader
    (issue #2293).

Details (mostly in chronological order - newest topmost):

-   Added DHCP auto-configuration for Network Manager (Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop):
    While ReaR supports DHCP auto-detection during 'rear mkrescue' of some
    DHCP setups, the Network Manager flavor on Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop was not
    supported so DHCP for the recovery system was not auto-enabled there
    (issue #2427).

-   OPALPBA (OUTPUT=RAWDISK): Workaround for EFI firmware glitch which
    prevents booting the real OS after unlocking SEDs. Symptom: Boot hangs
    when Grub hands over control to the Linux kernel. Seen on an HPE ML10Gen9
    server. The workaround is to add and remove a UEFI 'next boot' entry
    (essentially a no-op) which should convince the EFI firmware to use the
    boot order to determine the effective boot entry for the next boot (issue
    #2425).

-   Update default.conf: Describe LUKS_CRYPTSETUP_OPTIONS usage with some
    examples (issue #2389).

-   Overhauled how SSH config files are parsed for 'IdentityFile' values to
    find (and remove) unprotected SSH keys in the recovery system. Now "find
    ./etc/ssh" ensures that SSH 'Include' config files e.g. in
    /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/ are also parsed (issue #2421).

-   Update default.conf: Describe usage of non-quoted globbing patterns like
    VAR+=( /directory/* ) versus quoted globbing patterns like VAR+=(
    '/directory/*' ) and also describe how to prepend to an array in contrast
    to append to it (issue #2417).

-   When creating md5sums of the files in the recovery system be safe against
    blanks or special characters in file names by using appropriate options
    for all commands in the pipe (issues #2407 #1372).

-   Evaluate OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS at the beginning of lftp operations. Before
    OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS had been evaluated after connection to destination
    host was established which prohibited using OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS also for
    connection specific settings. Now OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS is moved to the
    beginning of lftp command before any other lftp command is executed (issue
    #2410).

-   For BACKUP=BORG implemented pagination when selecting the Borg archive to
    restore from: During "rear recover" all Borg archives are shown. In case
    of a long list only the last items had been visible to the user. Now
    pagination happens with a configurable number of Borg archives, see
    BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_MAX in default.conf (issue #2408).

-   For BACKUP=BORG updated generated locale filename from "rear.UTF-8" to
    "en_US.UTF-8" (issue #2402).

-   Use plain ${COPY_AS_IS[*]} instead of quoted "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" in the tar
    command call that copies things into the recovery system to ensure "things
    work as usually expected" for any methods that are used to add elements to
    the COPY_AS_IS array and better explain in default.conf how COPY_AS_IS
    works, in particular that symlinks cannot be followed and that files or
    directories that contain blanks or other $IFS characters cannot be
    specified (issue #2405).

-   For RAWDISK output add distribution-specific GRUB2 module 'linuxefi.mod'
    otherwise GRUB2 could not boot a UEFI rescue medium on Ubuntu 18.04 or
    20.04 (issue #2419).

-   ReaR was using hard-coded set of Grub2 modules for UEFI boot-loader. New
    GRUB2_MODULES_UEFI and GRUB2_MODULES_UEFI_LOAD config variables for
    installing GRUB2 as recovery system UEFI bootloader so that user can add
    or remove GRUB2 modules as needed (issues #2283 #2293 #2392).

-   No longer load GRUB2 modules efi_gop and efi_uga in function
    create_grub2_cfg: In the create_grub2_cfg function in
    lib/bootloader-functions.sh do no longer enforce loading the GRUB2 modules
    efi_gop and efi_uga because loading only the module all_video is
    sufficient and fail-safe because moddep.lst contains "all_video: efi_gop
    efi_uga" (issue #2388).

-   No longer load video_bochs and video_cirrus by the create_grub2_cfg
    function. In the create_grub2_cfg function in
    usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh that is used in case of UEFI to
    set up GRUB2 as bootloader for the recovery system do no longer let GRUB2
    load the modules video_bochs and video_cirrus because those are not
    available as GRUB2 modules in case of UEFI (x86_64-efi) and the generic
    "insmod all_video" that is still there should be sufficient for GRUB2
    (issue #2388).

-   Allow to boot original system from Grub menu (UEFI): This change adds
    following: Possibility to boot original system for UEFI boot with
    OUTPUT=NETFS and OUTPUT=USB (similarly to non UEFI ReaR rescue system).
    Replaces grub-mkimage for building of Grub2 boot image for OUTPUT=USB with
    build_bootx86_efi() (grub-mkstandalone). Replaces separate Grub
    configuration for OUTPUT=USB with create_grub2_cfg(). Using
    build_bootx86_efi() and create_grub2_cfg() in OUTPUT=USB will unify
    process of Grub boot image creation with OUTPUT=NETFS. (issue #2326)

-   Replace grub-mkimage with more sophisticated grub-mkstandalone when
    building GRUB2 image for using GRUB2 as recovery system UEFI bootloader
    (issue #2293).

-   When transferring ReaR recovery system ISO, create also destination
    directory structure (including parents). This is useful because when
    destination directory structure does not exist (or is incomplete), Lftp
    puts files into first available directory in OUTPUT_URL scheme (issue
    #2401).

-   Have CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="true" by default and explain it in
    default.conf (issue #2345).

-   New OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS config variable for lftp custom parameters (issue
    #2384).

-   Update 950_check_missing_programs.sh: When checking for required programs
    also test for "basename program" because when required programs are
    specified with absolute path those programs appears in the ReaR recovery
    system in /bin/ so testing their original path would falsely fail during
    "rear recover" (issue #2206).

-   New prep/USB//350_safeguard_error_out.sh safeguard scripts to let "rear
    mkrescue/mkbackup" error out in case of false usage of OUTPUT=USB on non
    PC-compatible (non-i386/x86/x86_64) architectures because with OUTPUT=USB
    on those architectures the USB medium cannot be booted (for those
    architectures there are no scripts that install a bootloader) and
    documented that in the OUTPUT=USB section in default.conf (issues #2348
    #2396).

-   Error out for unsupported workflows in any case: Before
    init/default/050_check_rear_recover_mode.sh did only error out when in the
    recovery system an unsupported workflow should be run. Now it also errors
    out when on the normal/original system an unsupported workflow that is
    likely destructive (in particular recover layoutonly restoreonly
    finalizeonly and mountonly) should be run (issues #2387 #2395).

-   Improve BorgBackup (short: Borg) integration into ReaR: Several
    improvements e.g. error handling, output to logfile etc. (issue #2382).

-   In backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh add "bs=1M" to
    SPLIT_COMMAND="dd of=$backuparchive bs=1M" to let 'dd' read and write up
    to 1MiB at a time to speed up things for example from only 500KiB/s (with
    the 'dd' default of 512 bytes) via a 100MBit network connection to about
    its full capacity (issue #2369).

-   Error out during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" when LUKS version 2 is used
    because LUKS version 2 is not supported. When LUKS version 2 is used it
    fails at least to determine the hash value so we use an empty hash value
    as a simple test if gathering crypt information was successful and error
    out if not. (issues #2204 #2381)

-   Auto-detect DHCP client with systemd-networkd plus completely overhauled
    and simplified code in prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh with
    resulting simplification of
    skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh (issue
    #2375).

-   Filter out duplicate entries in COPY_AS_IS but keep the ordering of the
    elements i.e. only the first occurrence of an element is kept. Also remove
    duplicates in the copy_as_is_filelist_file with 'sort -u' because here the
    ordering does not matter. (issue #2377)

-   Update 250_find_all_libs.sh: Removed unreliably working code that intends
    to filter out duplicates in the LIBS and COPS_AS_IS arrays via
    echo "${ARRAY[@]}" | tr ' ' '\n' | sort -u | tr '\n' ' '
    that fails when array elements contain spaces so better code
    should be used e.g. like
    printf '%s\n' "${ARRAY[@]}" | awk '!seen[$0]++'
    but filtering out duplicates is not needed and by the way
    cleaned up the whole script a bit. (issue #2377)

-   Skip Longhorn Engine replica devices (issue #2373).

-   Update 400_prep_yum.sh: For BACKUP=YUM error out if
    BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED is set because BACKUP=YUM does not support
    backup encryption (issue #2374).

-   Fail-safe patching of etc/ssh/sshd_config in the recovery system to ensure
    the needed ReaR settings/overrides actually apply. For example if
    etc/ssh/sshd_config contains a Match section at the end of the file
    e.g. appending "PermitRootLogin yes" will not be effective as a global
    setting but only in the Match section. Therefore now the needed ReaR
    settings are inserted at the beginning and all subsequent entries of that
    kind are disabled (commented out) to ensure that the ReaR global setting
    is the only one that is effective. (issue #2362)

-   Run what was build/default/985_fix_broken_links.sh now earlier as
    build/default/490_fix_broken_links.sh before files get modified in
    recovery system because otherwise e.g. if etc/ssh/sshd_config is a
    symbolic link build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh will fail to apply patches
    (issue #2360).

-   Use simpler and more fail-safe syntax ARRAY+=( additional elements )
    everywhere (issue #2364).

-   Update 58-start-dhclient.sh: Fixed issue #2354.

-   Added usr/share/rear/restore/OPALPBA/ directory to pass the test for
    SHARE_(D)IR/restore/BACKUP in prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh
    because the mkopalpba workflow uses the nonexistent BACKUP method OPALPBA
    to create a PBA image (issue #2351).

-   Fix OPALPBA: Could not change password on multiple SEDs at once. "rear
    opaladmin changePW" (when used without any extra argument or with multiple
    arguments) is meant to change the disk password on multiple
    self-encrypting drives in a single invocation. However, it stopped after
    successfully changing the password on the first drive and the password of
    subsequent drives had not been changed. (issue #2349)

-   Update 035_valid_backup_methods.sh: Simplified
    prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh to make it work more predictable
    and fail-safe (issue #2353).

-   Have a hardcoded '-iso-level 3' option in
    output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/820_create_iso_image.sh because it is also
    hardcoded in output/ISO/Linux-i386/820_create_iso_image.sh and it seems to
    also work in general on PPC64LE architecture (issue #2344).

-   Update default.conf: Adapt the explanation in default.conf how
    ISO_MAX_SIZE works (issue #2347).

-   Cleaned up and enhanced the ISO_MAX_SIZE implementation in
    backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh to make it in particular more safe
    against erroneous settings of the ISO_MAX_SIZE variable (issue #2344).

-   Added required NFS users for proper rpcbind startup: Usually 'rpcuser' is
    used but 'rpc' is used in RHEL7.x and '_rpc' is used in Debian 10 (issues
    #2341 #2342 #2250)

-   Cleaned up and enhanced 320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh plus
    some bugfixes where the old code presumably did not work. (issues #2310
    #2313 #2312)

-   Update 890_finish_checks.sh: In the WARNING message at the end of "rear
    recover" when no bootloader could be installed also mention
    usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660_install_grub2.sh as an example
    script how one could install a bootloader on POWER architecture.
    Furthermore since finalize/default/110_bind_mount_proc_sys_dev_run.sh it
    is no longer needed to manually mount /proc. (issues #2339 #2045)

-   Update 095_exclude_non_essential_files.sh: Added also /usr/lib/grub2 and
    /usr/share/grub2 to COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE because since openSUSE Leap 15.1
    things were moved from /usr/lib/grub2/ to /usr/share/grub2/ (issue #2338).

-   Update 270_create_grub2_efi_bootloader.sh: Test for Grub 2 EFI components
    directories /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi and now also for
    /usr/lib/grub2/x86_64-efi or /usr/share/grub2/x86_64-efi because since
    openSUSE Leap 15.1 things were moved from /usr/lib/grub2/ to
    /usr/share/grub2/ (issue #2338).

-   Update uefi-functions.sh: Use /usr//grub/x86_64-efi/partmap.lst instead of
    /usr/lib/grub*/x86_64-efi/partmap.lst because since openSUSE Leap 15.1
    things were moved from /usr/lib/grub2/ to /usr/share/grub2/ (issue #2338).

-   Update 630_install_grub.sh and 650_install_elilo.sh: Show the actual
    missing directory in the Error message (issue #2337).

-   Moved backup/default/005_valid_backup_methods.sh to
    prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh to also check for valid backup
    methods during "rear mkrescue" because for most external backup methods
    only "rear mkrescue" is used, cf. the section "BACKUP SOFTWARE
    INTEGRATION" in 'man rear' (issue #2337).

-   Changes to Data Protector branding, adjustment required to support the new
    Data Protector 10.x agent with Secure Socket Communication. Fixed some
    problems related to SessionID format and problems with object names like
    host type vs. file system backup (issue #2335).

-   Hard-coded root home directory string ("/root") was replaced with
    $ROOT_HOME_DIR that is the eeal home directory of root user (issue #2334).

-   Make USE_DHCLIENT and USE_STATIC_NETWORKING more fail-safe in ReaR
    recovery system (issue #2325).

-   For FDR backups, if the path for $FDRUPSTREAM_DATA_PATH does not exist,
    then create it. This change is FDR specific for s390 and is only in effect
    if ZVM_NAMING is "Y" (issue #2320).

-   Overhauled rescue/default/010_merge_skeletons.sh: Made
    010_merge_skeletons.sh behave more reliably. Now it errors out when things
    really went wrong. Now is is also supported that both a $skel_dir
    directory (e.g. usr/share/rear/skel/default/) plus a $skel_dir.tar.gz
    (e.g. usr/share/rear/skel/default.tar.gz) exist and then both get copied
    into the recovery system, first the directory and then the tar.gz so that
    via the tar.gz files from the $skel_dir directory could be overwritten if
    needed. (issues #2307 #2317)

-   Added $FDRUPSTREAM_DATA_PATH/rear to $COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_FDRUPSTREAM
    (issue #2318).

-   Added documentation about possible (dirty) workarounds for needed
    bind9-export libraries for CentOS 7.7 and 8.0 which is somewhat related to
    Rubrik-CDM (issues #2266 #2284).

-   Enhanced recovery system BIOS boot default settings for USB and ISO: For
    OUTPUT=ISO the user can now explicitly specify what to boot by default
    when booting the ISO on BIOS systems via ISO_DEFAULT="boothd0" to boot
    from the first disk and ISO_DEFAULT="boothd1" to boot from the second
    disk. For OUTPUT=USB the user can now explicitly specify what to boot by
    default when booting the disk on BIOS systems via
    USB_BIOS_BOOT_DEFAULT="boothd0" to boot from the first disk. The default
    USB_BIOS_BOOT_DEFAULT="" boots the second disk. (issues #2276 #2303)

-   Remove outdated /root/rear-DATE-TIMESTAMP.log symlinks. Before creating
    the current symlink to the current log file test all files that match the
    file name pattern of such symlinks and remove those already existing (old)
    symlinks where its now outdated symlink target is the current log file
    (issue #2301).

-   Initial preliminary first basic support for IBM Z architecture "s390x"
    (a.k.a. "z Systems", formerly "System/390", simply called "s390"):
    Currently primarily for Red Hat and SUSE enterprise systems so that
    interested users can try out early how far things work in their particular
    IBM Z environments and provide feedback preferably plus needed fixes,
    adaptions, and enhancements to ReaR upstream at
    https://github.com/rear/rear (issues #2137 #2142).

-   Improved 'is_multipath_path' function to be more fail safe that now tests
    (via "multipath -l" output) if multipath is used. Additionally have
    'lsblk' output as disklayout.conf header comments to make it easier to
    understand the values in the subsequent entries. Furthermore added 'xdd'
    to the PROGS array because sometimes a tool to display binary files is
    required in the recovery system. (issue #2298).

-   Error out during "rear mkrescue" in case of insufficient LVM tools:
    Overhauled layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh where now the exit code
    of the "lvm ..." calls are checked and it errors out if one fails in
    particular to avoid that entries in disklayout.conf are missing or broken
    when too old LVM tools are used that do not support the needed options of
    those "lvm ..." calls. Also in
    layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh a simple test was added
    to verify that the 'lvm...' entries in disklayout.conf look syntactically
    correct. Furthermore in 06-layout-configuration.adoc in the "Disk layout
    file syntax" section the exact same syntax for the "lvm..." entries is now
    listed as the headers of the "lvm..." entries in disklayout.conf are.
    (issues #2259 #2291)

-   Fixed missing delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones calls: Use same
    code as for disks for multipath devices (these are just regular disks),
    including MBR erasing and partition creation and cleanup:
    create_multipath() cannot call create_disk() because create_disk()
    verifies that the device is a block device, which it isn't with multipath
    because it's a symlink to a device mapper instead. Make sure new code
    handling re-creation of partitions and cleanup is used because Software
    Raid can have partitions since these are virtual disks. (issue #2281)

-   Moved 'route' back from REQUIRED_PROGS to PROGS. ReaR uses 'ip route'
    everywhere so 'route' is not actually required. As 'route' is no longer
    always installed nowadays, having it in REQUIRED_PROGS lets ReaR falsely
    error out on such systems (issues #1961 #1652).

-   Update 990_verify_rootfs.sh: Use a FDRUPSTREAM-specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
    find FDR libraries (issue #2296).

-   Do not run 'ldd' on untrusted files to mitigate possible ldd security
    issues because some versions of ldd may directly execute the file (see
    "man ldd") which happens as user 'root' during "rear mkrescue". The new
    TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS user config array contains user names that are trusted
    owners of files where RequiredSharedObjects calls ldd (cf. COPY_AS_IS) and
    where a ldd test is run inside the recovery system that tests all binaries
    for 'not found' libraries. Furthermore use
    '2>>/dev/$DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV' at more places to avoid that the "rear
    -D mkrescue" log file size would grow from about 5 MiB to about 17 MiB so
    that now that log file size even shrink to about 2 MiB. (issue #2279)

-   Initial draft implementation of the new 'mountonly' workflow to use ReaR
    as rescue system, therein mount the filesystems of the target system so
    that one can manually repair it. This is described in
    doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc (issue #2247).

-   Feature RAWDISK and OPALPBA improvements: RAWDISK: include additional Grub
    modules from /boot/grub (and /boot/grub2) which had formerly been missing.
    OPALPBA: improve Plymouth boot animation on Ubuntu, provide integration
    capabilities for other distros. RAWDISK: add support for distros which use
    'grub2' naming. (issue #2275)

-   Improved check for missing libraries in 990_verify_rootfs.sh so that now
    also libraries are checked that are no executables plus skipped the ldd
    test for firmware files (issue #2279).

-   Update default.conf: More explanatory comment in default.conf how
    COPY_AS_IS versus LIBS, PROGS, and REQUIRED_PROGS are meant to be used
    (issue #2278).

-   Accommodate logs from multiple FDR/Upstream services. Users may run
    multiple FDR/Upstream services on a single machine. This code change
    allows ReaR to copy FDR/Upstream logs from the recovery environment to the
    restored system for all running services. Previously the code was
    expecting to find only one set of logs and reports in the FDR/Upstream
    installation directory. For several years now, logs and reports have been
    stored in a new location ($FDRUPSTREAM_DATA_PATH), so we check here
    instead (issue #2251).

-   Update format-workflow.sh: Set EXIT_FAIL_MESSAGE=0 before exiting in "rear
    format - -help" to avoid the "rear format failed, check ...rear...log for
    details" message that is pointless in this case.

-   Added alternative for 'poweroff.com' that is 'poweroff.c32' on RHEL8
    (issue #2238).

-   Removed unnecessary line that sets NSRSERVER in
    layout/save/NSR/default/650_check_iso_recoverable.sh which prevented
    setting NSRSERVER in local.conf (issue #2162).

-   Enhanced default AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp ) plus
    explanatory comment in default.conf how AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH works (issues
    #2239 #2261).

-   Use is_true() for AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH and cleanup of the
    get_partition_number function that now errors out with BugError in cases
    that are likely a bug in ReaR (issues #2245 #2260).

-   Do not abort in case of invalid user input but retry if possible. When
    input values can be (syntactically) validated there is now a retry loop
    until the user provided valid input (or intentionally aborts) except those
    cases where it was not possible to implement validation when it is unknown
    what is valid for third-party tools (issue #2253).

-   Removed '2>/dev/null' redirection where possible: Some general cleanup for
    ReaR 2.6 in all scripts by removing '2>/dev/null' where it makes sense and
    replacing '&>/dev/null' by '1>/dev/null' where it makes sense or also
    removing '&>/dev/null' where that seems to be better (issue #1395). By the
    way verify/TSM/default/390_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh and
    verify/NBU/default/390_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh have
    been somewhat overhauled but both scripts still abort 'rear recover' when
    the user did an invalid date or time input (issue #2253).

-   Fix including of multipath disks in backup: The AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS logic
    traverses filesystems and tries to determine the associated underlying
    disks that should be kept. When having a filesystem fs:/A that is present
    on a multipath device MP and the root filesystem fs:/ that is present on a
    normal disk D, the code first established that fs:/A depends on fs:/
    resulting in marking D as used and then short-circuited processing of
    multipath devices. This resulted in MP not being considered as a used
    device and removed from the backup. The problem is fixed by removing the
    short-circuit logic in find_disk_and_multipath() so multipath devices get
    processed too unless AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH is true (issue #2236).

-   Improve handling of partition label type for multipath disks: When
    recording information about a multipath disk, ReaR did not store
    information about its partition label type in the 'multipath' entry in
    disklayout.conf. The recovery code tried to automatically detect the label
    type using a heuristic that depends on GPT partition names. The logic
    would incorrectly detect the device as having the MBR label type instead
    of GPT if one of the partition names was exactly "primary", "extended" or
    "logical". The problem is solved by explicitly storing the partition label
    type for multipath devices (same as is already done for normal disks) so
    that the syntax of the 'multipath' entries in disklayout.conf is changed
    and that new syntax is now documented in
    doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc The recovery code is
    accordingly updated to utilize this information (issue #2234).

-   In doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc updated links to SUSE documentation:
    Replaced the outdated link
    https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-12/book_sleha/data/cha_ha_rear.html
    that gets redirected to a not really helpful standard fallback page by the
    currently valid URL for the most recent SLE-HA-15-SP1
    https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP1/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html
    because meanwhile the SUSE documentation was moved to its own server. The
    more general and more comprehensive documentation URL
    https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery is kept and listed topmost
    (issue #2255).

-   Added explanatory comments to default.conf about backup restore that may
    fail for things like BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=("-zstd") due to missing
    zstd binaries in the ReaR recovery system probably also for -lzip -lzma
    -lzop (issue #2241).

-   New BACKUP=CDM method for Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) see
    doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc (issues #2248 #2249).

-   In verify/NETFS/default/050_start_required_nfs_daemons.sh all kind of
    '2>/dev/null' (i.e. also '&>/dev/null') are removed (so that '&>/dev/null'
    is replaced by '1>/dev/null') because in general '2>/dev/null' is
    unhelpful because it needlessly suppresses error messages in the log that
    would be helpful to see when something fails (issues #2250 #1395).

-   Update 06-layout-configuration.adoc: Changed section title from
    "Including/Excluding components" to only "Excluding components". The
    latter avoids possible misunderstanding that there would be a config
    variable to explicitly include something but "including" here describes
    only to disable autoecludes (issue #2229).

-   Update default.conf: At AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS removed the comment
    Explicitly excluding/including devices is generally a safer option because
    it is not actually helpful and even misleading because there is currently
    no config variable to explicitly include devices (issue #2229).

-   Do not keep the build dir when ReaR is run noninteractively by additional
    special values for the KEEP_BUILD_DIR config variable, see its description
    in default.conf (issue #2218).

-   Fix LVM2 thin pool recreation logic / use of vgcfgrestore is broken:
    Removing forcibly (with '-force' passed twice) seems to work for now. But
    our use of vgcfgrestore is probably not appropriate at all. It works by
    chance. Typically, it works only for Linear volumes, and won't probably
    for Caches and Raid hierarchies or when there are existing Snapshots on
    the system. The only proper solution is perhaps stop relying on
    vgcfgrestore at all, but then we are not capable of restoring volume
    groups and logical volumes with all properties from original system (issue
    #2222).

-   Use mountpoint instead of mount | grep (issue #2225).

-   Updated default.conf: Replaced ARRAY=( "${ARRAY[@]}" additional elements )
    with simpler and more fail safe ARRAY+=( additional elements ) (related to
    issues #2223 #2220).

-   Append to the CLONE_USERS and CLONE_GROUPS arrays by using += instead of
    expanding the previous value to an empty element which then causes
    problems later (issues #2223 #699).

-   Update 900_clone_users_and_groups.sh: Skip empty user and group values
    (issue #2220).

-   New use-case for BLOCKCLONE backup method for complex LUKS-encrypted
    filesystems by using the "multiple backups" approach with a second
    BLOCKCLONE phase with a dd image that contains the encrypted filesystem
    where unmounting the encrypted filesystem before creating its image and
    before restoring it has to be done via the new config variable
    BLOCKCLONE_TRY_UNMOUNT (issue #2200).

-   Fixed when ReaR does not detect an uncompressed kernel that is named
    'vmlinux' (instead of 'vmlinuz').

-   Added $BACKUP_OPTIONS to the line with mount_url in 800_copy_to_tftp.sh
    and 810_create_pxelinux_cfg.sh otherwise in case of OUTPUT=PXE mounting
    the NFS will fail.

-   UEFI: Search for Grub2 modules in /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi and not in
    /boot. On Fedora and RHEL systems, Grub2 UEFI modules live in
    /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi, not /boot, unless grub2-install is executed, but
    executing this tool is not needed with UEFI. On SUSE systems, Grub2 UEFI
    modules also live in /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi but there is also a copy in
    /boot, so it's not needed searching in /boot at all. Additionally, only
    UEFI modules should be looked for, so /boot cannot be searched but only
    /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi (similarly /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi, not just
    /usr/lib/grub*), otherwise we could get some false positives on dual boot
    systems (UEFI + Legacy), since modules for Legacy will also match, which
    is wrong (issues #2199 #2001).

-   RAWDISK and TCG Opal 2 Self-Encrypting Disks: Add Secure Boot support
    (issue #2166).

-   Avoid that disklayout.conf contains duplicate 'lvmvol' lines: Create the
    'lvmvol' lines commented out when multiple segments exist for a given LV.
    This is not an issue unless Migration Mode is used. In such case, using
    'lvcreate' commands already does best effort and loses LV information
    (issues #2194 #2187). Additionally do not overload the kval variable (that
    is intended for passing options to lvcreate) by adding extra keys to it,
    which are not supported by lvcreate. Introduce another variable infokval
    for this purpose and print those unsupported and purely informational keys
    only in comments (issue #2196).

-   Apply layout mappings also to other relevant files via
    layout/prepare/default/320_apply_mappings.sh In migration mode apply the
    disk layout mappings not only to disklayout.conf but also to other files
    that are also used to migrate the disk layout, namely
    VAR_DIR/layout/config/df.txt and /etc/rear/rescue.conf Additionally
    re-read the BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP variable from /etc/rear/rescue.conf
    because its value could have been migrated to a new value (issue #2181).

-   In the function apply_layout_mappings (therein in its "step 3") treat
    leftover temporary replacement words (like _REAR1_) as an error only if
    they are in a non-comment line (issue #2183).

-   When 420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh resizes the last partition on a GPT
    disk it leaves 33 LBA blocks at the end of the disk so that
    420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh produces a fully correct disklayout.conf
    file where no further automated adjustments by a subsequent script like
    100_include_partition_code.sh are done (issue #2182).

-   Error out when DHCLIENT_BIN and DHCLIENT6_BIN are empty and USE_DHCLIENT
    is set (issue #2184).

-   In build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh skip the ldd test for kernel modules
    because in general running ldd on kernel modules does not make sense and
    sometimes running ldd on kernel modules causes needless errors because
    sometimes that segfaults (issue #2177).

-   Bacula: Fixed 'bconsole' prompt not displaying at all when doing a recover
    (issue #2173).

-   Fixed that the EFI Boot Manager cannot be installed when the system has a
    NVMe SSD, because the device name is resolved as /dev/nvme0n1p rather than
    /dev/nvme0n1 so for NVMe devices the trailing 'p' in the Disk value as in
    /dev/nvme0n1p that is derived from /dev/nvme0n1p1 needs to be stripped to
    get /dev/nvme0n1 (issues #2160 #1564).

-   Changed double quotes (") to single quotes(') in documentation related to
    BORG_PASSPHRASE variable. Double quotes will not avoid expanding of
    variable when'$' sign is used inside pass phrase string, which can lead to
    unsuccessful opening of Borg archive (issue #2205).

-   More fail safe BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY handling: Use double quotes
    "$BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY" so that the BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY value can
    contain spaces. Escape special regexp characters in the
    BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY value when it is used as a regexp in grep or sed.
    Use single quotes BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY='my_passphrase' in the
    documentation examples so that the BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY value can contain
    special characters (except single quote). Recommend in default.conf to not
    use special characters in the BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY value to be to be on
    the safe side against things breaking in unexpected weird ways when
    certain code in ReaR is not yet safe against arbitrary special characters
    in values (issues #2157 #1372).

-   Avoid that the BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY value appears in a log file in
    particular when 'rear' is run in debugscript mode where 'set -x' is set by
    redirecting STDERR to /dev/null for those confidential commands that use
    the BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY value, cf. the comment of the UserInput function
    how to keep things confidential when 'rear' is run in debugscript mode
    (issues #2155 #2156).

-   Fix when recovery fails on LUKS-encrypted filesystem using simple password
    because only the first 2 parameters in /etc/crypttab are mandatory (issue
    #2151).

-   Generic enhancements for IBM Z (s390) to support 'dasd' disks and SUSE
    specific enhancements to install during "rear recover" the special GRUB2
    plus ZIPL bootloader on SLES12 and later via the new
    finalize/SUSE_LINUX/s390/660_install_grub2_and_zipl.sh script (issues
    #2137 #2150).

-   Cleanup of the OUTPUT=RAMDISK code. Overhauled 900_copy_ramdisk.sh as
    architecture independent new script
    output/RAMDISK/default/900_copy_ramdisk.sh that replaces
    output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900_copy_ramdisk.sh and overhauled
    conf/templates/RESULT_usage_RAMDISK.txt plus better description of
    OUTPUT=RAMDISK and RESULT_FILES in default.conf (issue #2148).

-   Enable creation of non consecutive partitions (issues #2081 #1793 #1771
    #1681).

-   The new SUSE-specific script finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/675_install_shim.sh
    calls 'shim-install' inside chroot on the recreated target system and uses
    boot/grub2/grub.cfg as input to recreate two needed (identical) EFI files
    /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi/core.efi and /boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/grubx64.efi
    (issue #2116).

-   Fixed that output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh falsely errors out when
    an output method OUTPUT=FOO is used where there is no matching
    usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT_usage_FOO.txt because when it is
    missing it is no sufficient reason to error out. Furthermore now
    950_copy_result_files.sh is skipped when RESULT_FILES is empty because
    that means there is no actual output and then it is not needed to only
    copy VERSION README and LOGFILE to the output location (issue #2147).

Version 2.5 (May 2019)

Abstract

New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes:

-   Enhancements to better support mmcblk/eMMC disks: An "eMMC" device could
    be not only one single disk but actually consist of several 'disk' type
    block devices for example the actually usable disk /dev/mmcblk0 (with its
    partitions like /dev/mmcblk0p1 and /dev/mmcblk0p2) plus special additional
    disks on the same eMMC device like /dev/mmcblk0boot0 and /dev/mmcblk0boot1
    and /dev/mmcblk0rpmb (issue #2087).

-   Now there is in default.conf MODULES=( 'all_modules' ) which means that
    now by default all kernel modules get included in the recovery system
    (issue #2041). Usually this is required when migrating to different
    hardware. Additionally it makes the recovery system better prepared when
    this or that additional kernel module is needed, e.g. to ensure a USB
    keyboard is usable in the recovery system (issue #1870) or to ensure data
    on external medium (e.g. iso9660) can be read (issue #1202). Furthermore
    this is helpful to be on the safe side against possibly missing dependent
    kernel modules that are not automatically found (issue #1355). The
    drawback of MODULES=( 'all_modules' ) is that it makes the recovery system
    (and its ISO image) somewhat bigger (see issue #2041 for some numbers).
    With MODULES=() the old behaviour can be still specified. There is a minor
    backward incompatible change: Before the user had to specify in
    etc/rear/local.conf MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" 'moduleX' 'moduleY' ) to get
    some specific modules included in addition to the ones via an empty
    MODULES=() but now the user must specify MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )
    for that because with "${MODULES[@]}" the new default value 'all_modules'
    would be kept which would trigger that all modules get included so that
    now `MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )` includes
    all kernel modules in the recovery system which includes in particular
    'moduleX' and 'moduleY' so that things still work but with a bigger
    recovery system. For details see the MODULES description in default.conf.

-   The new verify script layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh
    verifies the disklayout.conf file that is created by "rear
    mkrescue/mkbackup". Currently only some very basic verification is
    implemented: It verifies that the 'disk' entries look syntactically
    correct (only basic value type testing), the 'part' entries look
    syntactically correct (only basic value type testing), the 'part' entries
    specify consecutive partitions. The latter is needed to make ReaR more
    fail-safe in case of sparse partition schemes (i.e. when there are
    non-consecutive partitions) because currently "rear recover" fails when
    there are non-consecutive partitions (issue #1681). In general
    verification of the created disklayout.conf should help to avoid failures
    when it is too late (i.e. when "rear recover" fails). It is better to
    error out early during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup". It may happen that
    layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh falsely lets "rear
    mkrescue/mkbackup" error out because of false alarm. The immediate
    workaround for the user in such cases is to remove that script or skip
    what it does by adding a 'return 0' command at its very beginning.

-   Basic support for EFISTUB booting: Via the new config variable EFI_STUB
    (see default.conf) the user can (and if needed must) specify that the
    recreated system should boot via EFISTUB. If EFI_STUB is specified but
    some boot loader like GRUB2 or ELILO is used on the original system, the
    recreated system gets migrated to boot (only) via EFISTUB.

-   The whole 'rear dump' output format need to be changed to improve it to
    clearly distinguish array elements.

-   Now during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" md5sums are created for all regular
    files in in the recovery system and stored as /md5sums.txt in the recovery
    system. During recovery system startup it verifies those md5sums. Via the
    new config variable EXCLUDE_MD5SUM_VERIFICATION (see default.conf) the
    user can specify what files should be excluded from being verified to
    avoid errors on "false positives".

-   GRUB2 installation on x86 and ppc64le architecture was completely
    rewritten and enhanced by the new config variable GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES
    (see default.conf) so that now the user can specify what he wants if
    needed and in MIGRATION_MODE disk mappings are applied when devices in
    GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES match.

Details (mostly in chronological order - newest topmost):

-   In packaging/rpm/rear.spec reactivated 'BuildRoot' and 'defattr' because
    both are required for building 'rear' RPM packages on SLES 11 and RHEL 5 /
    CentOS 5 via the openSUSE Build Service and removed /etc/cron.d/rear and
    related things (issues #2135 #1855 #1856 #1908 #1892)

-   In layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh continue with
    the next disk if the current one has no partitions otherwise the "Find the
    last partition for the current disk" code fails (issue #2134)

-   Improved handling of broken symlinks inside the recovery system: Relative
    symbolic links are now properly handled. Directories, which are link
    targets, are not copied into the recovery system but a meaningful hint is
    printed that COPY_AS_IS can be used for that (issues #2129 #2130 #2131)

-   In layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/135_include_btrfs_subvolumes_generic_code.sh
    fixed 'btrfs subvolume set-default' command for older versions of
    'btrfsprogs' where that command requires both arguments 'subvolid' and
    'path' (issue #2119)

-   For backup NBU: Exclude the whole '/usr/openv/netbackup/logs' directory
    instead of only the files in that directory (issue #2132)

-   Fixed layout mapping error when TCG Opal 2 self-encrypting disks were
    present but had to be excluded due to a non-existent disk during recovery.
    This exclusion was not handled properly (issue #2126)

-   In build/default/995_md5sums_rootfs.sh also exclude all files with a
    trailing '~' in their name because those are also excluded when the
    recovery system initrd is made by pack/GNU/Linux/900_create_initramfs.sh
    (issue #2127)

-   Suppressed unwanted "Welcome to Relax-and-Recover ..." etc/motd messages
    from 'chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash -login ...' calls that appear in the log
    file or in the stdout of the chroot call when the output is further
    processes by 'grep' by redirecting stdin of the chroot call to /dev/null
    because no input is needed (issues #2120 #2125)

-   Replace RULE_FILES with a global UDEV_NET_MAC_RULE_FILES in default.conf
    (issues #2074 #2123)

-   Added comment to default.conf that tells when KEEP_BUILD_DIR is
    automatically set to true (issue #2121)

-   Added /usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/lib/ to NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH in
    default.conf (issues #2105 #2122)

-   Simplified awk constructs in 320_include_uefi_env.sh into using plain grep
    and a bash array to avoid inexplicable wrong behaviour in some cases that
    is somehow related to the nullglob bash option together with different
    kind of awk (issues #2095 #2115)

-   For older systems (e.g. like SLES11) where /dev is no mountpoint in the
    recovery system we first mount TARGET_FS_ROOT/dev as 'tmpfs' and then we
    copy all /dev contents from the recovery system into TARGET_FS_ROOT/dev to
    make all recovery system /dev contents available at TARGET_FS_ROOT/dev
    (which are needed therein for things like "chroot TARGET_FS_ROOT
    mkinitrd") but only as long as the recovery system runs. On the rebooted
    target system its pristine /dev will be there. This is basically what
    finalize/default/100_populate_dev.sh had done but now without dirty
    remainders on the user's target system disk (issue #2113).

-   Do not copy symlink targets in /proc/ /sys/ /dev/ or /run/ into the ReaR
    recovery system. For example on SLES11 /lib/udev/devices/core is a symlink
    to /proc/kcore so that "rear mkrescue" basically hangs up while copying
    /proc/kcore because it is huge (issue #2112)

-   Avoid needless things when there is more than one disk: Avoid tot go into
    MIGRATION_MODE in any case when there is more than one disk. Avoid that
    GRUB2 gets needlessly installed two times on the same device (issue #2108)

-   Fixed disk device name in efibootmgr call for eMMC devices: For eMMC
    devices the trailing 'p' in the disk device name (as in /dev/mmcblk0p that
    is derived from /dev/mmcblk0p1) needs to be stripped (to get
    /dev/mmcblk0), otherwise the efibootmgr call fails because of a wrong disk
    device name (issue #2103)

-   For Ubuntu 18.x use /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf as /etc/resolv.conf
    in the recovery system: Basically the /etc/resolv.conf symlink target and
    /lib/systemd/resolv.conf contain only the systemd-resolved stub resolver
    "nameserver 127.0.0.53" and only /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf contains
    a real nameserver (issues #2018 #2101)

-   When mktemp needs to be called with a TEMPLATE call it with sufficient
    XXXXXXXXXX in the TEMPLATE, otherwise use the mktemp default (issue #2092)

-   LPAR/PPC64 bootlist was incorrectly set when having multiple 'prep'
    partitions: Use the specific right syntax for array expansion of the
    boot_list array (issues #2096 #2097 #2098 #1068)

-   Ensure that the Error function results a direct and complete exit of the
    whole running 'rear' program even if the Error function was called from a
    (possibly nested) subshell in a sourced script: Now the Error function
    terminates all descendant processes of MASTER_PID except MASTER_PID and
    the current (subshell) process that runs the Error function and when Error
    was called from a subshell it finally exits its own subshell so that when
    the Error function finished only MASTER_PID is still running and finally
    MASTER_PID exits as usual via the DoExitTasks function (issues #2088 #2089
    #2099)

-   Ignore special additional disks on eMMC devices named "rpmb" and "boot":
    Now the extract_partitions() function skips device nodes on eMMC devices
    like /dev/mmcblk0rpmb or /dev/mmcblk0boot0 and /dev/mmcblk0boot1 because
    ReaR wrongly recognized those 'disk' type block devices as if they were
    'part' type block devices, i.e. those are no partitions, but special
    additional disks on the eMMC device (issue #2087)

-   Updated the OPALPBA workflow: Set USE_RESOLV_CONF='no' as networking is
    not required/available in the PBA. Avoid copying in the entire
    /etc/alternatives directory as its links could pull in lots of unwanted
    stuff, which is not required in rescue systems. Clean up plymouth/unlock
    service startup (issue #2083)

-   Network: Record permanent mac address when device is enslaved in a Team,
    or else /etc/mac-addresses will record broken information. Use "ethtool
    -P" as the preferred method to retrieve the MAC address. Otherwise fall
    back to other methods, which may lead to some invalid MAC address when
    using Teams (issues #1954 #2065)

-   Added 'net-tools' to Debian dependencies as required for 'route' command
    which belongs to the REQUIRED_PROGS (issue #2082)

-   Added an additional separated new btrfs_subvolumes_setup_generic()
    function to recreate all mounted Btrfs subvolumes in a more generic way.
    The old btrfs_subvolumes_setup function was renamed into
    btrfs_subvolumes_setup_SLES and this one is called as fallback to be
    backward compatible. For both btrfs_subvolumes_setup implementations it is
    individually configurable which one is used for which btrfs device via the
    new config variables BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP and
    BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_GENERIC_SETUP. Currently it is not documented because it
    is work in progress where arbitrary further changes will happen (e.g. the
    current btrfs_subvolumes_setup_generic function makes diskrestore.sh fail
    on older systems where 'btrfs subvolume set-default' needs two arguments)
    so one has to inspect the current code and comments in the
    layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13X_include_... scripts to see how things currently
    work (issues #2067 #2079 #2080 #2084 #2085)

-   Fixed SSH root login on the recovery system with some configurations: On
    Ubuntu 18.04 with OpenSSH 7.6, /etc/ssh/sshd_config contains commented-out
    lines for 'PermitRootLogin' and other options. This fix makes sure that
    settings changed for sshd in the ReaR recovery system will be real, not
    comments (issue #2070)

-   RAWDISK output: Improved device partition detection (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04).
    On Ubuntu 18.04, it has been observed that after creating a loop device
    and creating a properly sized VFAT file system >250 MB on it, after
    mounting the file system size was actually just 30 MB. Reason: The
    partition detection did not pick up the correct partition sizes of the
    associated image file. This change uses losetup's -partscan option
    (supported by util-linux v2.21 and above) to offer one additional
    opportunity to detect partitions. If the option is not available, a
    traditional losetup call will be used as a fallback (issue #2071)

-   OPALPBA output fix: Do not include any PBA into another PBA. A TCG Opal
    pre-boot authentication (PBA) system is a minimal operating system
    constructed by ReaR to unlock self-encrpyting disks before the regular OS
    takes over. Before this PR, it could happen that a previously created PBA
    was included in a subsequently created PBA, causing it to be unnecessarily
    large (issue ##2072)

-   Now there is in default.conf MODULES=( 'all_modules' ) which means that
    now by default all kernel modules get included in the recovery system
    (issues #2041 #1870 #1202 #1355)

-   New verify script layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh to
    verify disklayout.conf that was created by "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"
    (issues #2060 #1681)

-   Refresh udev with trigger before activating multipath (issue #2064):
    Ensure that all information from multipath devices is updated by udev into
    /sys before activating multipath. This helps to mitigate certain kind of
    issues when something wrong in the SAN zoning configuration (issues #2002
    #2016 #2019)

-   For backup NSR: It is of additional use to not skip the retrieval of the
    filesystems even in NSR_CLIENT_MODE so that this is now also done in
    NSR_CLIENT_MODE: Due to saving the save sets filesystem information in
    $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_paths within the recovery image one is able to
    retrieve/read this information during a recovery process i.e. for advising
    the EMC networker server team to recover the appropriate
    filesystem(-structure) from the backups being made (issue #2058)

-   Skip patching absolute symlinks during finalize stage (issue #2055). That
    does not actually fix issue #1338 but for now it should at least avoid
    patching wrong files. Furthermore do no longer create udev rules in the
    recreated system that have not been there. This way one can avoid that
    ReaR creates udev rules that are created and maintained by systemd/udev
    like /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules when one excludes such udev
    rules from being restored from the backup or by moving them away via
    BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES (issue #770)

-   Now /proc /sys /dev and /run are bind-mounted into TARGET_FS_ROOT at the
    beginning of the finalize stage via the new
    110_bind_mount_proc_sys_dev_run.sh script and existing code in various
    finalize scripts for mounting /proc /sys /dev and things like that was
    removed and the finalize scripts were adapted and renumbered as needed
    (issues #2045 #2035)

-   Added eno-fix.rules to RULE_FILES for LAN interface MAC address changes to
    the ens-style LAN interface names instead of the older eno-type LAN names
    and aligned RULE_FILES content in the involved scripts (issue #2046)

-   Fixed 58-start-dhclient.sh script to make it work reliably with multiple
    network interfaces (issue #2038)

-   Borg backup restore enhancements and fixes: Added checks whether we can
    read Borg archive, user can enable progress display via
    BORGBACKUP_SHOW_PROGRESS="yes", corrected mounting of USB device when
    using Borg (issues #2029 #2037)

-   Fix for GRUB2 EFI modules search directory location: Instead of looking
    for GRUB2 modules only in /boot also find them in /usr/lib/grub*, where
    GRUB2 modules are normally installed by default (issue #2039)

-   Basic support for EFISTUB booting plus documentation (issues #1942 #2030)

-   Multipath optimizations: Optimized get_device_name() by calling "dmsetup
    info" only once, and for "dm" devices only. Removed collecting output of
    /sys/class/fc_transport since it can be very slow and is not used (issues
    #2020 #2034)

-   Suppress dispensable 'set -x' debug output unless called with
    '-debugscripts x': A noticeable part (25% and more) of the 'set -x'
    debugscripts output is usually of no interest and therefore such output is
    suppressed by default (e.g. when rear is called with '-D') unless rear is
    called with '-debugscripts x' where the full debugscripts output is still
    there as it was before (issue #2024)

-   Cleaned up the Docker specific exclude part in 230_filesystem_layout.sh:
    Determine docker_root_dir only once and try to be safer against possibly
    crippled Docker installations (e.g. timeout 'docker info') and be safe
    against empty docker_root_dir (otherwise all mountpoints would match the
    empty string and we would would skip all mountpoints) and show possible
    errors to the user in any case (issues #1989 #2021)

-   Improved setup of /etc/resolv.conf in the recovery system: In case of
    static networking setup in the recovery system a plain traditional
    /etc/resolv.conf file with an entry of a remote 'nameserver
    DNS.server.IP.address' is needed. It cannot work when /etc/resolv.conf
    contains only loopback IP addresses (which happens when the stub resolver
    systemd-resolved is used) or when there is no nameserver entry so that
    "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" errors out in this case. In contrast when
    USE_DHCLIENT is true (e.g. when DHCP is used on the original system) then
    during recovery system startup /etc/resolv.conf will be generated by
    /bin/dhclient-script so that it does not matter what its content was
    before. For special cases the user can specify what he wants via the new
    USE_RESOLV_CONF variable (issues #2015 #2018 #2076)

-   Improved 'rear dump' output to clearly distinguish array elements. The
    whole 'rear dump' output format was changed. Now it shows normal string
    variables as STRING="string of words" and arrays as a
    beautified/simplified 'declare -p' output as
    ARRAY=("first element" "second element" ... ) unless in debug mode where
    the plain 'declare -p' output is shown like
    declare -- STRING="string of words" and
    declare -a ARRAY=([0]="first element" [1]="second element" ... ) that is
    needed for complicated array elements that contain brackets. Furthermore
    now the 'rear dump' output can be directly sourced (issue #2014)

-   Error out when we cannot make a bootable EFI image of GRUB2 which is
    required when UEFI is used (issue 2013)

-   Allow non-interactive authentication with rsync by using
    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS to specify the "-password-file=/full/path/to/file"
    rsync option (issue #2011)

-   Add possibility for user to specify whether or not show Borg stats at the
    end of backup session (issue #2008)

-   Adaption for Fedora 29: grub2-efi-x64-modules does not contain linuxefi
    module (issue #2001)

-   Let the user optionally specify mkfs.xfs options if needed to recreate XFS
    filesystems with different options than before (e.g. in MIGRATION_MODE
    because of different replacement hardware) via the new MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS
    config variable (issue #2005)

-   Network interface renaming: Automatically map device to its new name when
    device is found on the system with same MAC address but different name
    (issue #2004)

-   It is no BugError when neither getty nor agetty are available. Such a case
    it is an Error because the user must have the programs in REQUIRED_PROGS
    installed on his system

-   Fix for 'error:unrecognized number' when booting ISO on PPC: Issue is
    caused by incorrect, according to PAPR specification, bootinfo entity
    parsing code in GRUB2 (issue #1978)

-   Fixed that in recovery system DHCP client did not iterate through all
    network interfaces. It incorrectly took only the first one. If the
    interface that is intended for recovery was not the first one, it had
    failed (issue #1986)

-   Automatically exclude BUILD_DIR from the backup. When TMPDIR was specified
    to something not in /tmp, BUILD_DIR was not automatically excluded from
    the backup (issue #1993)

-   Support ISOs bigger than 4GiB with OUTPUT=ISO by including the udf kernel
    module into the recovery system when mkisofs or genisoimage is used (not
    needed for xorrisoifs) and enable creating an hybrid iso9660/udf DVD
    (issue #1836)

-   Cleaned up how KERNEL_FILE is set: Now the KERNEL_FILE variable is set in
    the 'prep' stage only by the new prep/GNU/Linux/400_guess_kernel.sh that
    replaces the old pack/GNU/Linux/400_guess_kernel.sh and all the various
    different 300_copy_kernel.sh scripts (except
    output/USB/Linux-i386/830_copy_kernel_initrd.sh) are removed because the
    300_copy_kernel.sh scripts had also only set the KERNEL_FILE variable in
    various ways. Additionally it errors out in various output stage scripts
    when kernel or initrd are missing and it shows aligned error messages in
    those cases to the user. Finally it errors out when the file does not
    exist or is a broken symlink. (issues #1851 #1983 #1985)

-   Enhanced and more robust exclude of vfat filesystem (ESP) from SELinux
    relabeling during recover process (issue #1977)

-   Fixed NBU (NetBackup) not working since ReaR 2.4: With NetBackup, too many
    binaries were included, causing the recovery system verification to fail
    or print error messages. A new NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable is used during
    verification. The RequiredSharedOjects() function was fixed to not list
    the left part of the ldd mapping when there is a right part: Some
    NetBackup libraries have a mapping such as "/lib/ld64.so =>
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2", causing the RequiredSharedOjects() function
    to print "/lib/ld64.so" which does not resolve (issue #1974)

-   Add /etc/ca-certificates directory to recovery system (issue #1971)

-   Skip 630_run_efibootmgr.sh when UEFI_BOOTLOADER is empty or not a regular
    file and determine the ESP mountpoint from UEFI_BOOTLOADER and use
    $TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi as fallback plus corrected logic whether or not
    NOBOOTLOADER is set empty (issues #1942 #1945)

-   Missing libraries in recovery system caused executables to fail because
    libraries were skipped from copying when their library path was a
    substring of another already copied library, for example /path/to/lib was
    skipped when /other/path/to/lib was already copied (issue #1975)

-   Check for carriage return in local/site/rescue.conf files (issue #1965)

-   Specific required programs are added to REQUIRED_PROGS depending on what
    component keywords are used in disklayout.conf (issue #1963)

-   Cleanup and enhancement of REQUIRED_PROGS and PROGS checks (issue #1962)

-   Moved PROGS from GNU/Linux.conf to default.conf REQUIRED_PROGS (issue
    #892)

-   Record permanent mac address when device is enslaved in a bond, or else
    /etc/mac-addresses will record broken information (issue #1954)

-   For Slackware Linux: Added automatic OS vendor and version detection.
    Added logic to search for kernel files when the standard ELILO kernel
    install paths come up empty. Added legacy LILO bootloader support.

-   Enhanced and cleaned up 985_fix_broken_links.sh to find symlinks in the
    recovery system where the link target is outside of the recovery system
    and in such cases the missing link target gets copied into the recovery
    system plus more verbose error reporting to the user (issue #1638)

-   Fixed that the FindStorageDrivers function failed on kernels with no
    modules. When MODULES=( 'no_modules' ) is set FindStorageDrivers() is now
    skipped (issue #1941)

-   Increased the default USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE from 200 to 400 MiB (issue #1205)

-   Enhanced rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh for Bonding and Teaming
    when it is configured with LACP. Bonding should not be simplified in this
    case plus added code for non-simplified Teaming (issue #1926). Furthermore
    simplified/hardened the tests/setup1 and tests/setup2 testbeds.

-   In 500_clone_keyboard_mappings.sh avoid running find in the whole tree of
    filesystems which takes ages (issue #1906)

-   Let 100_include_partition_code.sh error out when the parted command is not
    there (issue #1933)

-   Suppress bash stderr messages like 'unary operator expected' or 'integer
    expression expected' where a particular 'test' intentionally also fails
    this way (issue #1931)

-   Show errors to the user via LogPrintError instead of only LogPrint because
    LogPrint outputs only in case of verbose mode (issue #1914)

-   Avoid dangling symlinks when copying ReaR config files into the ReaR
    recovery system by copying the content of the symlink target via 'cp -L'
    (issue #1923)

-   Avoid 'nullglob' pitfalls in 250_populate_efibootimg.sh and generally
    overhalued that script (issue #1921)

-   Check that CONFIG_DIR is a directory (issue #1815)

-   Avoid bash error messages like: "eq: unary operator expected" when using
    older versions of xfsprogs (issue #1915)

-   Added exclusion of zram devices from device mapping in default.conf. By
    default zram devices are not to be mapped, exactly as it is done for
    ramdisk and loop devices (issue #1916)

-   Fixed a non-working awk command in the generate_layout_dependencies()
    function that falsely also matched commented '#btrfsmountedsubvol' entries
    in disklayout.conf with an egrep command that is more in line with how it
    had worked before (issue #1497)

-   Fixed and enhanced NETFS+tar backup pipe exit code handling (issue #1913)

-   Moved the functionality of the recovery system setup script
    67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh into the mount_url function 'iso' case plus
    additional enhancements there with a user dialog if things are not o.k.
    and removed the no longer needed 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh (issues #1893
    #1891 #326)

-   Fixed that on LPAR/PPC64 PowerVM the boot devices order list was
    incorrectly set (via 'bootlist') when having multiple 'prep' partitions.
    Now handling of multiple 'prep' partitions was added plus enhanced
    handling of multiple prep partitions and multipath (issue #1886)

-   Fixed and enhanced the get_disk_size and get_block_size functions so that
    now by default blockdev is used (if exists) to retrieve the size of the
    disk and its block size and compute partition start using 512 bytes blocks
    (this is hardcoded in the Linux kernel) to fix wrong partition information
    when a disk has 4K block size (issue #1884)

-   Print multipath device name during "rear recover" when "firendly_name"
    option is off (issue #1889)

-   Now the Error function shows some last messages of the last sourced script
    to the user (issues #1877 #1875)

-   Duplicity: Misc improvements (issues #1876 #1879 #1882)

-   Added code to recognize persistent LAN interface and manipulate
    KERNEL_CMDLINE (issue #1874)

-   Initial tentative support for OBDR on ppc64le (issue #1868)

-   Wait for systemd-udevd to avoid broken pipe error in
    40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh (issue #1832)

-   Avoid duplicate UUID in boot menuentry when snapper is used (issue #1871)

-   Added choice to confirm identical layout mapping only once plus disabling
    MIGRATION_MODE (issue #1857)

-   Verify md5sums of files in recovery system (issues #1859 #1895)

-   Fedora28: syslinux needs libcom32.c32 to boot from HD and missing
    ldlinux.c32 and libutil.c32 prevents PXE booting (issues #1861, #1866)

-   Add support for Slackware UEFI/USB (issues #1853, #1863)

-   RAWDISK output portability improvements (issue #1846)

-   Fixed, simplified, and enhanced GRUB2 installation on x86 and ppc64le
    architecture (issues #1828, #1845, #1847, #1437)

Version 2.4 (June 2018)

Abstract

New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes:

-   Major rework and changed default behaviour how ReaR behaves in migration
    mode when partitions can or must be resized to fit on replacement disks
    with different size. The new default behaviour is that only the partition
    end value of the last partition on a disk (and therefore its partition
    size) may get changed if really needed but no partition start value gets
    changed to avoid changes of the partition alignment. The new
    420_autoresize_last_partitions script implements the new behaviour and the
    old 400_autoresize_disks was renamed into 430_autoresize_all_partitions to
    still provide the old behaviour if that is explicitly requested by the
    user but the old behaviour may result unexpected changes of arbitrary
    partitions on a disk. The new config variables AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS
    AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE
    AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE determine how ReaR behaves in
    migration mode when partitions can or must be resized. With
    AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS='yes' the old behaviour is done. With
    AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS='no' no partition is resized by ReaR. With the
    default AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS='' at most the last active partition on each
    active disk gets resized but only if really needed which also depends on
    the settings of the other config variables above. For details see
    default.conf and the two 'autoresize' scripts. For some examples see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733

-   Network setup was completely reworked to support bonding, bridges, vlans
    and teaming. There is a full rewrite of the 310_network_devices.sh script
    generating network interfaces for use during ReaR rescue/recovery system
    networking setup via the 60-network-devices.sh script. It also handles
    corner cases/odd setups that can be found from time to time, typically
    when the administrator uses bonding plus bridges plus vlans as well as
    teaming.

-   Initial (limited) support for certain ARM based hardware. It should work
    with Raspberry Pis, most TI and Allwinner devices. There are two ARM
    specific BOOTLOADER variable values where 'ARM-ALLWINNER' is for Allwinner
    devices that will backup and restore the 2nd stage bootloader versus plain
    'ARM' which is a dummy that does nothing so that on Raspberry Pi and most
    TI devices you need to include the first FAT partition (with the MLO or
    bootcode.bin) in your backup.

-   Simplified and enhanced TSM restore plus first draft of TSM backup.

-   EMC Avamar support has been added.

-   Duplicity backup has been seriously enhanced.

-   Support for TCG Opal 2-compliant self-encrypting disks and RAWDISK output.

-   YUM+backup adds the ability to backup and restore files to the YUM method.

    #1765)

-   Skip LUKS encrypted disks when guessing bootloader (issue #1779)

    (issue #1751)

-   Run exit tasks code with default bash flags and options (issues #700,

keep up with the development in the Linux area. We love you all... :-)

Version 2.3 (December 2017)

Abstract

New features and bigger enhancements:

-   First steps towards running Relax-and-Recover unattended in general.
    Several user dialogs that had been implemented in ReaR via the bash
    builtin 'read' or the bash 'select' keyword are now implemented via the
    new UserInput function. The UserInput function proceeds with a default
    input value after a timeout so that it is now possible to let ReaR run
    unattended with its default behaviour. Additionally one can predefine an
    automated input value for each particular UserInput function call so that
    it is now also possible for the user to predefine what ReaR should do when
    running unattended. For details see the USER_INPUT_... config variables in
    default.conf. Currently not all user dialogs use the UserInput function so
    that this or that user dialog needs to be adapted when it is reported to
    us via our issue tracker https://github.com/rear/rear/issues
    In contrast when programs that are called by ReaR work interactively
    (e.g. third-party backup tools that show user dialogs or password prompts)
    the program call itself must be adapted to run unattended (if possible),
    see the section 'It should be possible to run ReaR unattended' in our
    https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style
    Wiki article.

-   SSH support in the ReaR rescue/recovery system was overhauled. By default
    it is now secure which means the recovery system is free of SSH secrets.
    Individual settings can be specified via the SSH_FILES,
    SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS, and SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD config variables (for
    details see default.conf).

-   Improved verification of the ReaR rescue/recovery system contents. Now
    during 'rear mkrescue/mkbackup' there is a verification step where 'ldd'
    tests for each program/binary and library in the recovery system whether
    or not its required binaries/libraries can be found in the recovery
    system.

-   Improved autodetection during 'rear recover' when disks on the replacement
    hardware seem to not match compared to what there was on the original
    system so that ReaR is now more fail-safe against recreating on a possibly
    wrong disk.

Possibly backward incompatible changes:

-   In addition to STDERR now also STDOUT is redirected into the ReaR log
    file. Accordingly all output of programs that are called by ReaR is now in
    the log file so that the log file content is more complete and there is no
    longer unintended verbose information from programs on the terminal where
    ReaR was launched. On the other hand this means when programs prompt via
    STDOUT to get some user input (e.g. a program prompts for a user
    confirmation under this or that circumstances) the program's STDOUT prompt
    is no longer visible to the user when the program was not called properly
    in the particular ReaR script as described in the section 'What to do with
    stdin, stdout, and stderr' in our
    https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style Wiki article. We tried to
    fix as many program calls as possible but it is impossible (with
    reasonable effort / with a reasonable amount of time) to check all program
    calls in all ReaR scripts so that this or that unnoticed program call will
    need to be fixed when it is reported to us via our issue tracker
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues

-   SSH support in the ReaR rescue/recovery system is now secure by default.
    There are no longer private SSH keys in the recovery system by default and
    a RSA key is generated from scratch when starting sshd during recovery
    system startup. Accordingly it does no longer work by default to use SSH
    in the recovery system via the SSH keys that exist on the original system.
    To get SSH keys included in the recovery system use the SSH_FILES and
    SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS config variables (for details see
    default.conf).

-   Verification of required binaries/libraries in the ReaR rescue/recovery
    system. By default it is now fatal when 'ldd' reports a 'not found'
    library for any file in a /bin/ or /sbin/ directory in the recovery system
    so that now 'rear mkrescue/mkbackup' may fail where it had (blindly)
    worked before. In particular third-party backup tools sometimes use their
    libraries via unexpected ways which can cause 'false alarm' by the 'ldd'
    test. With the new config variable NON_FATAL_BINARIES_WITH_MISSING_LIBRARY
    one can specify for which files a 'not found' library should be considered
    as 'false alarm' (for details see default.conf).

-   Improved MIGRATION_MODE autodetection when the disk layout looks
    ambiguous. Now 'rear recover' switches by default more often into
    MIGRATION_MODE where manual disk layout configuration happens via several
    user dialogs so that by default 'rear recover' shows more often user
    dialogs compared to before but the intended behaviour can be enforced via
    the MIGRATION_MODE config variable (for details see default.conf).

Details (mostly in chronological order):

-   Use /etc/os-release and /etc/system-release before falling back to
    lsb_release check in function SetOSVendorAndVersion (issues #1611, #731)

-   Make BACKUP_URL=iso for mkrescue and mkbackuponly no longer fatal (issue
    #1613)

-   Add ntpdate support (issue #1608)

-   Fix for XFS file system recreation code. In xfsprogs >= 4.7 log section
    sunit=0 is considered invalid (issue #1603)

-   Changed the macro fedora_release into fedora in the rear.spec file (issue
    #1192 and bz1419512)

-   Borg backup as back end now displays progress, when ReaR is launched in
    verbose mode (issue #1594)

-   Better MIGRATION_MODE autodetection (pull request #1593 related to issue
    #1271)

-   With the new config variable NON_FATAL_BINARIES_WITH_MISSING_LIBRARY the
    user can specify what programs where the 'ldd' test reports 'not found'
    libraries are non-fatal so that those programs in the recovery system do
    not lead to an Error abort of "rear mkrescue/mkbackup". This is a generic
    method so that the user can avoid issues in particular with third-party
    backup tools that sometimes have unexpected ways to use their specific
    libraries like https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533 (for TSM) and
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1560 (for FDR/Upstream).

-   Add a NSR_CLIENT_MODE to the backup method NSR (issue #1584)

-   Let /bin/ldd detect *.so with relative paths (issue #1560)

-   Add support for Bridge Interfaces(issue #1570). Usually, virtual
    interfaces are skipped, but for Bridges to work, we consider Bridges as
    physical interfaces, because the Bridge interface holds the IP address,
    not the physical interface attached to the Bridge. This patch enables
    those configurations:

    -   Bridge over simple Ethernet
    -   Bridge over Bond
    -   Bridge over Vlan interface

-   Use UserInput in some more usual places to improve that 'rear recover' can
    run unattended in migration mode (issues #1573, #1399)

-   Error out for OUTPUT_URL=null together with OUTPUT=USB (issue #1571)

-   Added/updated paths for FDR/Upstream 4.0 because FDR/Upstream 4.0 includes
    changes to some file paths (issue #1559)

-   Fix copying kernel modules when module aliases are present (issue #1567)

-   Netbackup agents not automatically started on RHEL 7 (issue #1523)

-   Forbid mkrescue and mkbackuponly for iso backup scheme (issues #1547,
    #1548)

-   Only support OpenSSH 3.1 and later for SSH setup (issue #1530)

-   Implemented USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL (issue #1535)

-   Split network-functions.sh into DHCP setup and general ReaR functions
    (issue #1517)

-   Avoid leaking unprotected SSH private key files onto rescue medium (issues
    #1512, #1513)

-   Improve cryptographic security and user-friendliness for LUKS volumes
    (issue #1493)

-   Improve ReaR network migration (issues #1605, #1510, #1399)

-   Improved encrypted password detection in 500_ssh.sh (issue #1503)

-   Several code improvements in the way libraries are detected and copied
    (issues #1521, #1502, #1494)

-   Allow btrfsmountedsubvol to be excluded via EXCLUDE_RECREATE (issue #1497)

-   Avoid recreation of non-existing btrfs subvolumes (issue #1496)

-   Add automatically some important kernel parameters to KERNEL_CMDLINE
    (issue #1495)

-   Cleanup and simplified default input for the UserInput function (issue
    #1498)

-   Avoid systemd log messages about multiple disk partitions with identical
    name that happened because ReaR used a static 'rear-noname' for originally
    unnamed partitions. Original gpt disk partitions may be unnamed but parted
    requires a name for each gpt partition. Now ReaR uses the basename of the
    partition device path (e.g. sda1, sda2) for originally unnamed partitions
    (issue #1483)

-   Enhanced how the ssh user is copied into the recovery system and improved
    detection of the ssh user (issue #1489)

-   Use meaningful variable for automated UserInput. Enforce calling UserInput
    with a UserInput ID so that automated UserInput is always possible for the
    user. Use and enforce uppercase letters in UserInput IDs because the
    resulting variable names are meant as user config variables (issue #1473)

-   Fix UEFI tools integration (issues #1477, #1478)

-   Added a new YUM backup method which will recreate the system by installing
    it from scratch via installing RPM packages. The YUM backup method uses
    the yum package manager in the same manner as the ZYPPER backup method
    (issue #1464)

-   BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS used to be a string variable, turn it into an array
    (issue #1475)

-   Now CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS always extends the CLONE_USERS and CLONE_GROUPS
    arrays (issues #1471, #1464)

-   PXE code improvements (issue #1466)

-   Several improvements in the multipath code to allow full migration (issues
    #1449, #1450)

-   Several improvements on the TSM code (issues #1539, #1461, #1452)

-   Activate btrfs filesystem creation with uuid. Recent btrfs version finally
    added this option (issue #1463)

-   By default a directories_permissions_owner_group file is created that
    saves permissions, owner, and group of basic directories plus symbolic
    link names and link targets of basic directories. Those basic directories
    are the currently used mountpoints (except some unwanted "noise" from all
    what there is mounted) plus the directories of the Filesystem Hierarchy
    Standard (FHS) that actually exist on the system. Additionally with the
    new DIRECTORIES_TO_CREATE array the user can now explicitly specify
    directories and symlinks that are still missing in his particular
    environment (issue #1459)

-   Fix for cryptsetup hang on cryptsetup luksOpen ... when dmsetup is not
    present in recovery system (issue #1458)

-   Enhance MOUNTPOINTS_TO_RESTORE into DIRECTORIES_TO_CREATE (issue #1455)

-   Several improvements for ppc64le/ppc64 arch. Systemd automatic serial
    console detection, lilo and yaboot improvements (issue #1446, #1442)

-   Introduction of UserInput in 300_map_disks.sh (issues 1399 and 1431)

-   Adapt /etc/motd when 'rear recover' is running to avoid the additional
    'Run rear recover to restore your system' message that only makes sense as
    long as 'rear recover' was not ever started (issue 1433)

-   SLES12 with btrfs but without snapshots failed to recreate/mount btrfs
    FS/subvolumes during recovery (issue #1036)

-   Adapt chrp-boot option when xorrisofs is used. Xorrisofs use
    -chrp-boot-part option to generate PPC boot while mkisofs use -chrp (issue
    #1430)

Version 2.2 (July 2017)

-   Let the get_disk_size() function retry several times to be more fail-safe
    when udev needs some time until device files appear. This introduces the
    new generic helper function retry_command() plus the new config variables
    REAR_SLEEP_DELAY and REAR_MAX_RETRIES. For details see default.conf and
    lib/layout-functions.sh (issue #1370)

-   ReaR failed to continue due incorrect check of presence of USB device
    (REAR-000) in /proc/mounts, despite foregoing script
    (060_mount_NETFS_path.sh) did mounting of this device (issue #1415)

-   Add missing privilege separation dir to start sshd on Debian 9 (issue
    #1381)

-   Redirect rsync verbose output to backup log (issue #1387)

-   Load storage controllers in rescue system in same order as on host system
    (issue #1384):

    -   Copy over modules from initrd on SUSE LINUX
    -   Prevent sorting of MODULES_LOAD array to keep the order intended

-   Add /yaboot to ISO_FILE when running SUSE ppc64 (issue #1414)

-   Add SSL cert directories so we can interact with Google Cloud Storage
    (issue #1402)

-   Modified the "unattended" into "automatic" with ISO_DEFAULT required for
    automated recovery tests (issue #1397)

-   Use the original fds when ReaR was launched (which are now saved as fd6,
    fd7, and fd8 for stdin, stdout, and stderr respectively) for actually
    intended user input and user output. To keep backward compatible behaviour
    all old deprecated usage of '>&8' is converted into '>/dev/null' but
    /dev/null usage in general should be cleaned up later (issues #887, #1395)

-   Added new generic UserInput and UserOutput plus LogUserOutput functions
    that are intended to replace current user input functionality that calls
    select or read directly. For the next ReaR version 2.3 it is planned to
    also redirect stdout into the log file in addition to stderr (issues #885,
    #1366, #1398, #1399)

-   The 'make rpm' now relies on 'make srpm' which creates the src.rpm package
    first. This src.rpm package can then be easily copied to another computer
    to rebuild a rpm package from it without needed the sources itself (or git
    checkout) (issue #1389)

-   Replaced some perl regexp with grep native extended regexp (issue #1376)

-   Introducing SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER variable in default.conf. This variable
    should enable users booting with Secure Boot, to use whatever custom
    signed boot loader they like, and removes hard coded entry 'shim.efi' from
    the ReaR code (issue #1374)

-   Enhanced and cleaned up making ISO on POWER (ppc64/ppc64le). Now the
    backup can be stored in the ISO (via BACKUP_URL=iso...) and even multiple
    ISOs work on POWER now (issues #697, #1383)

-   Create multipath.conf only during migration (from non-multipath to
    multipath), and always copy /etc/multipath/bindings to the TARGET_FS_ROOT
    (issues #1382, #1393)

Version 2.1 (June 2017)

-   Support for Grub2 installation with software RAID1 on Linux on POWER
    (ppc64/ppc64le) (issue #1369)

-   REBUILD_INITRAMFS variable was introduced. The new default.conf setting
    REBUILD_INITRAMFS="yes" rebuilds the initramfs/initrd during "rear
    recover" to be more on the safe side. With REBUILD_INITRAMFS="" the old
    behaviour can still be specified (issue #1321)

-   ISO_RECOVER_MODE=unattended mode (issue #1351) - required for automated
    ReaR testing with OUTPUT=ISO

-   MODULES variable supports now special values like 'all_modules',
    'loaded_modules', 'no_modules' (issues #1202, #1355)

    bootloader on ppc ppc64 (issues #629 and #631)

-   Support the Oracle Linux 6 ksplice module (issue #605)

    BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY to avoid crib (issue #568)

-   Mount vfat file system without special mount options seems to work much
    better then with these options in recovery mode, therefore, we do not use
    these anymore (especially for /boot/efi) (issue #576)

-   Elilo support has been added for SLES (not fully tested yet) - issue #583

-   Grub2 rescue menu has been added (enable this feature with
    GRUB_RESCUE=y) - issue #589

-   split script 31_include_uefi_tools.sh in two pieces:
    31_include_uefi_tools.sh: to grab the UEFI tools (as long as /boot/efi is
    mounted), and 32_include_uefi_env.sh: to dig deeper into the configuration
    when UEFI is active (related to issue #214)

    This is necessary to have to UEFI tools on SLES 11/12 where we cannot
    create an UEFI bootable ISO image. We must boot in BIOS mode, and need the
    UEFI tools to make the system bootable over UEFI.

-   It is now possible to format an USB disk with a vfat and ext3 partition
    (for UEFI booting) - issue #593

    rear -v format -- --efi /dev/<usbdevice>

    package (Ubuntu 15.04) (issue #584)

-   Debian 8 support added with ISO booting with latest syslinux release as
    well (issues #596, #599 and #600)

-   Changed the behavior of SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD - now saved as MD5 hash
    password, but backwards compatibility is still respected (issue #560)

-   For EMC NetWorker server/client we added some exclude items to
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NSR (issue #571)

-   Removed the Warning message from main usr/sbin/rear script as it was
    misleading (issues #563 and #564)

-   output/ISO/Linux-i386/80_create_isofs.sh: make sure ISO_FILES[@] are
    copied to isofs directory (issue #569)

System and Software Requirements

Relax-and-Recover works on GNU/Linux kernel with version 2.6 and higher. For
lower kernel versions Relax-and-Recover cannot be used, and for these systems,
mkcdrec http://mkcdrec.sourceforge.net/ is still a good alternative.

As Relax-and-Recover has been solely written in the bash language we need the
bash shell which is standard available on all GNU/Linux based systems. The
default backup program Relax-and-Recover uses is GNU/tar which is also
standard available.

Relax-and-Recover is known to work well on x86, x86_64 and ppc64(le) based
architectures. Relax-and-Recover has also been ported to ia64 and arm
architectures, but these are less tested. Use the 'rear validate' command
after every successful DR test please and mail us the results.

Choosing the best compression algorithm

The default backup program with Relax-and-Recover is (BACKUP_PROG=tar) GNU tar
and the default compression used with tar is gzip. However, is using gzip the
best choice? We have done some tests and published the results. See
Relax-and-Recover compression tests
http://www.it3.be/2013/09/16/NETFS-compression-tests/

Support

Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) is an Open Source project under GPL v3 license which
means it is free to use and modify. However, the creators of ReaR have spend
many, many hours in development and support. We will only give free of charge
support in our free time (and when work/home balance allows it).

That does not mean we let our user basis in the cold as we do deliver support
as a service (not free of charge).

Supported and Unsupported Operating Systems

We try to keep our wiki page Test Matrix ReaR 2.7
https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-ReaR-2.7
up-to-date with feedback we receive from the community.

ReaR 2.7 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:

-   Fedora 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34
-   RHEL 6, 7, 8, and 9
-   CentOS 6, 7, and 8
-   Scientific Linux 6 and 7
-   SLES 12 and 15
-   openSUSE Leap 15.x
-   Debian 8, and 9
-   Ubuntu 16, 17, and 18

ReaR 2.7 dropped official support for the following Linux based operating
systems:

-   Fedora < 29
-   RHEL < 6
-   CentOS < 6
-   Scientific Linux < 6
-   SLES < 12
-   openSUSE Leap 42.x and before (i.e. openSUSE <= 13)
-   openSUSE Tumbleweed
-   Debian < 8
-   Ubuntu < 16

Usually ReaR 2.7 should also work on newer versions of the above listed
supported Linux based operating systems but sometimes arbitrary failures can
happen when software that is used by ReaR (like partitioning tools, filesystem
tools, bootloader tools, ISO image creating tools, networking tools, and so
on) changes in not fully backward compatible ways or when there are
innovations of the basic system (like kernel, storage, bootloader, init,
networking, and so on) that are not yet supported by ReaR.

In theory ReaR 2.7 should work on openSUSE Tumbleweed but in practice
arbitrary failures could happen at any time because the Tumbleweed
distribution is a pure rolling release version of openSUSE containing the
latest stable versions of all software
(cf. https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) so arbitrary changes of any
software are possible at any time that could arbitrarily break how ReaR works.

ReaR 2.7 may still work for SLES 11 and openSUSE Leap 42.x or even earlier
openSUSE versions but it is no longer sufficiently well tested there so
arbitrary regressions could appear. For example recreating LUKS encrypted volumes
does no longer work with SLES11 SP4 because cryptsetup 1.1.3 in SLES11 SP4 does
not support UUID and some other cryptsetup options that are used by default in ReaR 2.7.

ReaR 2.7 and earlier versions are known to no longer work reasonably well for
the following Linux based operating systems:

-   RHEL 5 (and probably also CentOS 5): See issue #1766
-   SLES 9 and 10: See issue #1842

If you require support for unsupported Linux operating systems you must
acquire a ReaR support contract.

Requests to port ReaR to another operating system (not Linux) can only be
achieved with serious sponsoring.

Supported and Unsupported Architectures

ReaR 2.7 is supported on:

-   Intel x86 type of processors
-   AMD x86 type of processors
-   PPC64 processors
-   PPC64LE processors

ReaR 2.7 may or may not work on:

-   Intel Itanium processors
-   ARM type of processors
-   IBM Z "s390x" type of processors

ReaR 2.7 does not support:

-   old PPC (32bit) processors

If you feel the need to get a fully functional ReaR working on one of the
above mentioned types of processors please buy consultancy from one of our
official developers.

Supported ReaR versions

ReaR has a long history (since 2006) and we cannot support all released
versions. If you have a problem we urge you to install the latest stable ReaR
version or the development version (available on GitHub) before submitting an
issue.

We understand that it is not always possible to install on hundreds of systems
the latest version so we are willing to support previous versions of ReaR when
you buy a support contract. We cannot handle the big amount of support
requests anymore on a voluntary base and we must give paid projects priority,
therefore, we urge our customers to buy a support contract for one or more
systems. You buy time with our core developers.

Known Problems and Workarounds

Issue Description: 'rear' package on Ubuntu 14.04 depends on isolinux package
(which does not exist)

-   Workaround:

Read the comments in https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1403

Issue Description: tar -test-label is not supported on Centos 5 who have tar
version 1.15

-   Workaround:

Issue Description: BACKUP=NSR on RHEL 6 could break yum

https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/387
describes a problem seen on RHEL 6 where when rear uses NSR and
afterwards the link /lib64/libexpat.so.1 has been changed.

-   Workaround:

So far there is no workaround for this issue.

Issue Description: usage of an alternative configuration directory is
different in mkbackup or recover mode

Using rear -v -c /etc/rear/mydir mkbackup works fine in production, but when
you try (once booted from rescue image) rear -v -c /etc/rear/mydir recover it
will fail.

-   Workaround:

The configuration files are copied to /etc/rear/ into the rescue image, so you
need to type: rear -v recover See issue #512

Issue Description: Is there a possibility to add btrfs subvolume to a rsync
backup

-   Workaround:

At present (release 1.18) there is no workaround in place. If you happen to
know how this could be fixed then add your ideas to
https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/417

Issue Description: UEFI ISO booting does not work on openSUSE 12.x, or SLES
11/12

-   Workaround:

At present (release 1.18.x and higher) genisoimage cannot produce ISO images
that can boot via UEFI on an openSUSE distribution (and also SLES). However,
use the ebiso package
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_11_SP3/x86_64/ebiso-0.2.3-1.x86_64.rpm
instead to create UEFI ISO images on SLES.

Issue Description: System reconfiguration still has some weaknesses.

-   this has to be tested before relying on it, there are too many unknowns
    involved so that we cannot guarantee anything in this area. It has been
    developed mostly as a P2V tool to migrate HP servers to VMware Vms

-   hard disks need to be at least of the same size and amount as in the
    original system, ATM this is a simple 1:1 mapping of old to new disks,
    there is no removal of RAID groups or merging of smaller disks onto a
    bigger one or making stuff smaller.

-   any use of /dev/disk/by-path or /dev/disk/by-id is untested and will most
    likely not work. In some cases Relax-and-Recover will print a warning, but
    we are not able to detect all cases. Typically this leads to unbootable
    systems or bad /etc/fstab files

Issue Description: If SELinux is not disabled during backup (variable
BACKUP_SELINUX_DISABLE= in /etc/rear/local.conf) then we might see errors in
the rear-$(hostname).log file such as:

    tar: var/cache/yum/i386/15/updates/packages: Cannot setfilecon: No such file or directory

-   Workaround:

Make sure the BACKUP_URL destination understands extended attributes (CIFS is
out of the question and NFS is problematic). When using local disks (or
external USB devices) make sure the proper mount options are given in the
BACKUP_OPTIONS variable, e.g.:

    BACKUP_OPTIONS="rw,relatime,seclabel,user_xattr,acl,barrier=1,data=ordered"

(TIP) BACKUP_SELINUX_DISABLE=1 variable has been introduced in the
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf file to disable SELinux while the backup is
running (default setting).

Issue Description: ERROR: FindStorageDrivers called but STORAGE_DRIVERS is
empty

Above error message might be seen after a fresh installation of the GNU/Linux
kernel. ReaR got confused between the running kernel version number and the
actual fresh kernel available.

-   Workaround:

Reboot your server before using ReaR again, which is a good practice anyway
after upgrading the GNU/Linux kernel.
