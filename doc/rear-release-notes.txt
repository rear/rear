## Overview
Relax-and-Recover is a GNU/Linux system administrator tool used to
create disaster recovery images which makes bare metal restore easier.
System administrators use Relax-and-Recover as part of disaster recovery
policy which does not replace in any way a good backup policy.


### Product Features
The following features are supported on the most recent releases of
Relax-and-Recover.  Anything labeled as (*NEW!*) was added as the
most recent release. New functionality for previous releases can be
seen in the next chapter that details each release.

The most recent release of Relax-and-Recover is supported on most GNU/Linux
based systems with kernel 2.6 or higher. It provides the following
functionality:

* Hot maintenance capability. A rescue image can be made online while
  the system is running.

* Command line interface. Relax-and-Recover doesnot require a graphical
  interface to run, nor in creation mode, nor in rescue mode (console
  is enough).

* Support included for most common file systems, such as ext2, ext3, ext4
  and reiserfs. Other filesystems like jfs, xfs and btrfs are also
  implemented, but are less tested. _(Feedback is appreciated)_

* Selected Hardware RAID and (eg. HP SmartArray) and mirroring solutions (eg.
  DRBD) are supported.

* LVM root volumes are supported.

* Multipath support for SAN storage

* UEFI support

* Integrates with _internal_ backup solutions such as:

   - GNU tar (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar)
   - GNU tar (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar, BACKUP_TYPE=incremental, FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon") for using incremental backups with a weekly full backup. Be aware, old tar archives will not be removed automatically!
   - GNU tar with openssl encryption (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar, BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED=1)
   - rsync on local devices (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=rsync), such USB and local disks
   - Rsync over the network (BACKUP=RSYNC, BACKUP_PROG=rsync)

* Integrates with _external_ backup solutions such as:

  - Tivoli Storage Manager (BACKUP=TSM)
  - HP Data Protector (BACKUP=DP)
  - Symantec NetBacakup (BACKUP=NBU)
  - Galaxy 5, 6 and 7 (BACKUP=GALAXY)
  - Bacula (BACKUP=BACULA)
  - Bareos (BACKUP=BAREOS) (*New!*) (A fork of Bacula)
  - Rsync Backup Made Easy (BACKUP=RBME)
  - Duplicity/Duply (BACKUP=DUPLICITY) (*New!*)
  - EMC Networker, also known as Legato (BACKUP=NSR)
  - SEP Sesam (BACKUP=SESAM) (*New!*)

* Udev support (except for some really ancient udev versions) which is
  the base for many new and important features:

  - kernel drivers for network cards and storage adapters are loaded via udev
  - deal with network persistent names in udev rules
  - firmware loading
  - persistent storage device names (though Relax-and-Recover does nothing with this)

* System reconfiguration

  - enable recovery on hardware, that is not the same as the original system
  - network and storage drivers are adjusted
  - map hard disks if they do not match (e.g. hda -> sda)
  - remap network MAC addresses
  - use another IP address, or using dhcp via templates or from kernel command line
  - rebuild the initial ramdisk if needed (for new storage drivers)
  - migration to SAN storage (*New!* *Experimental*)

* Support backup software: Bacula, both locally attached tapes (with
  bextract) and network-based backups. Also, in combination with OBDR tapes.

* Create OBDR tapes with method `mkbackup` and put the backup onto the tape
  to have a single-tape bootable recovery solution

* Label the OBDR tape with the method `format` to avoid accidental
  overwrites with OBDR

* Create bootable disk (eSATA, USB ...) media with the backup included:

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/device

    Together with `OUTPUT=USB` we have now a complete solution on hard disks
    (booting of it and restoring data).

* DHCP client support (IPv4 and IPv6). Dhcp client activation
  can be forced via the variable *USE_DHCLIENT=yes* (define in _/etc/rear/local.conf_).
  It is also possible to force DHCP at boot time with kernel option `dhcp`

* By default, if DHCP is used, static network configuration is ignored.
  Override this with *USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=yes* in
  _/etc/rear/local.conf_.

* Save layout and compare layouts for easy automation of making
  Relax-and-Recover snapshots (checklayout option)

* The *layout* workflow is the default workflow instead of the
  deprecated *dr* workflow. The *dr* workflow kept all important
  system information into a directory structure where the new *layout*
  workflow use files to keep the information centralized. The *dr* workflow
  has been removed in rear v1.14!

* External USB booting now uses extlinux instead of syslinux, and
  therefore, the USB disk must first be formatted with an ext2, ext3, ext4
  or btrfs based file system

* cron job to check changes in disk layout and trigger `rear mkrescue` if required

* VLAN tagging support (*New!*)

* Add timestamp of rear run with rc code to the syslog or messages file; sending mail report is also possible

*NOTE*: Features marked *experimental* are prone to change with future releases.


## Relax-and-Recover Releases
The first release of Relax-and-Recover, version 1.0, was posted to the web
in July 2006.  For each release, this chapter lists the new features and
defect fixes. Note that all releases are cumulative, and that all releases
of Relax-and-Recover are compatible with previous versions of
Relax-and-Recover, unless otherwise noted.

The references pointing to *fix #nr* or *issue #nr* refer to our [issues tracker](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)


### Version 1.17.0

* A new configuration option, `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y`, will cause statically configured network settings to be applied even when `USE_DHCLIENT` is in effect.

### Version 1.16.1 (June 2014)

* The validate rule for `xarg bash -n` changed into `xarg -n bash -n` so that rear is working correctly with older bash version 3 as well. Especially required for SLES 10, SLES 11 and EPEL 5 (issue #410).

* Adding an updated rear man page and the correct release notes to the 1.16.1 sub-release. In rear 1.16.0 these were forgotten.

* Code style improvements (issue #409).

* Improvements around btrfs file system recognition and re-creation (issues #408 and #415).

* Important fix for grub2 with OpenSuse 13 (changed LOADER into LOADER_TYPE).

* Added example prep script to verify if extlinux is present (issue #250) - this type of script could be cloned for other important executables in various workflows.

### Version 1.16.0 (May 2014)

As usual lots of bug fixes - see the issue tracker.

* Network script now deals correctly with VLAN tagging as well

* Added 2 new variables to `default.conf` for TSM: `TSM_ARCHIVE_MGMT_CLASS` which defines a backup class to use with TSM, and `TSM_RM_ISOFILE` which triggers (if set to y) to remove the original ISO files from local system once the ISO image has been transferred to TSM

* Guessing the bootloader and saving this in a file in the `$VAR_LIB/recovery/bootloader` (will be picke dup during recovery to assist us in selecting the proper bootloader [ grub, grub2, uefi ])

* Various corrections with `BACKYP=RSYNC` method (issue #200 and #366). In rear 1.16 the old and new style are still recognized, but we might drop the old style in later versions.

       OLD STYLE:
       BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST:PATH           # using ssh (no rsh)
       with rsync protocol PATH is a MODULE name defined in remote /etc/rsyncd.conf file
       BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST::PATH          # using rsync
       
       NEW STYLE:
       BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using ssh
       BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]::/PATH  # using rsync

* Checking the bootloader files during savelayout section - see issue #234

* Backup method `BACKUP=DUPLICITY` has been fully tested and proven to work well (backup and recover). When using `duply` and automated recovery is possible. Several updates were made to make duplicity works as well with backup and recover

* Variable `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD` (see `default.conf`) allows to force a password with the rescue image (issue #362)

* TSM version >=6.4 is now supported (issue #356), and point in time restore works better now (issue #358)

* Fix the order of `fs` lines in `checklayout.conf` file when mor ethen 9 partitions are in use (issue #352)

* Avoiding CD/DVD type devices to be added in the disklayout.conf file during savelayout (issue #257)

* Removed `mingetty` executable from `REQUIRED_PROGS` list as RHEL 7 does not ship it anymore. `agetty` is getting more and more the standard now and rear will use this one automatically when `mingetty` is absent

* New variable in `default.conf` file was defined `BACKUP_TYPE=` (empty is full or incremental; only works with the default `BACKUP_PROG=tar`)

* Avoid stale NFS hangs with `df` command (issue #350)

* For TSM a new variable was introduced in `default.conf` file: TSM_RESULT_SAVE (to disable the TSM saving; can be used when you saved the result via `$ISO_URL`, `$OUTPUT_URL`, `$ISO_DIR` or something else)

* `/etc/rear/local.conf` is now empty by default and `/etc/rear/site.conf` now contains `OUTPUT=ISO` setting. This way we are sure that during an upgrade of rear we do not loose our original user settings (local.conf tends te be overwritten).

* Fix for hpacucli where the order logicaldrive and array could be wrong (issue #208)

* New variable TMPDIR allows to overrule the default `/tmp` temporary directory (handy when building big ISO images)

* Added option `-iso-level 3` to `mkisofs` command so we can create ISO image bigger then 4 GB (issue #323)

* detecting 'out of space' errors while building huge ISO images

* Add SEP Sesam external backup integration - issues #324 and #325

* Add automatic recovery mode for Bareos - issue #311

* Add incremental backup type with GNU tar with weekly backups, define in _/etc/rear/local.conf_ the following (issue #294):

       BACKUP=NETFS
       BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
       FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon"

* Add support for Gentoo kernels - issue #312

### Version 1.15.0 (September 2013)

The references pointing to *fix #nr* or *issue #nr* refer to our [issues tracker](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)

As usual lots of bug fixes - see the issue tracker.

* Add EMC NetWorker (Legato) support for doing _external_ backup

* Add Bareos (Backup Archive REcovery Open Sourced) support for doing _external_ backup (bareos
  is a fork of the open source backup suite Bacula)

* Align the usage of KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY and NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY and make them behave sane.
  See also issue #192

* Add the --selinux option to be safe with SELinux context restoration (with GNU tar)

* Add an option to exclude modules on the rescue system

  default.conf: EXCLUDE_MODULES=()

* Add integrity check when BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP_PROG=tar with the option BACKUP_INTEGRITY_CHECK

* Add an option to define a root password to allow SSH connection whithout a public/private key pair (#272)
  
  default.conf: SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD=

* Implement the "splitted backup to iso" feature.  To use that, BACKUP_URL has to use the iso://[subdirs] scheme but
  a different OUTPUT_URL has to be defined (issues #278 and #287). New parameter ISO_MAX_SIZE introduced.

* Fix SELinux autorelabelling (issue #270 and #274)

* Rear supports now more then 9 partitions (see issue #263)

* systemd support added for Fedora 19/20 and OpenSuse 12.x/13.x

* Automatic Recover feature on USB devices (label AUTOMATIC RECOVER in rear recover menu)

* Add an option to copy all users and group. It is usefull in the case we want to restore ACL of all users. See default.conf:

  CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS=n

* Example prep script to detect missing lftp (fix #247)

* Using POSIX output format in df.txt (fix #248)

* Recognize OracleServer as a Fedora derivate

* Allow basic network configuration from the command line

* Create directory $PXE_TFTP_LOCAL_PATH if it does not exist (fix #244, issue #244)

* Support booting syslinux v5 (issue #238)

* Fix installing grub when /boot is inside the root filesystem (issue #210)

* Deal with BTRFS subvolumes correctly (issue #233 and #252)

* Recognize OracleServer as a Fedora derivate

* Added UEFI integration within rear (including booting ISO images)

* Improved dataprotector GUI interaction (issue #189)

* Secure backup was introduced (issue #196)
  
    Add to /etc/rear/local.conf:
    BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED=1
    BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY="secretkey"

* Added fixes recomended by RedHat Bugzilla report #882175

* OUTPUT_URL scheme approvement (issue #37)

* Netbackup improvement for xinetd (issue #180)

* LOGFILE variable can be overruled now (issue #56)

* Support for RBME restores over NFS

* Packaging support introduced for Arch Linux

* Added support for sshfs transport with BACKUP=NETFS (issue #171)

* Re-introduced /dev/disk/by-id migration which was lost since release 1.7.22 (issue #22)

* Updates required for systemd for fedora 18 and 19.

* Check if ROOT_FS filesystem was mounted with 'noexec' attribute (issue #150)

### Version 1.14.0 (September 2012)

The references pointing to *fix#nr* refer to our [issues tracker](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)

Lots of minor bugs were fixed, and not all of them are listed in current release notes. For a
complete overview see the issue tracker.

* Added duply/duplicity with one new backup method duplicity (*Experimental*)

* Systemd supported on Fedora 17 and OpenSuse 12.2 (fix #115, #126)

* Create correct yaboot dir on ppc (fix #109)

* Add new RAMDISK output method. This writes the kernel and the initramfs to the location given in OUTPUT_URL.

* Packaging - introduction of Makefile; cleanup dr workflow (fix #13, #49)

* Make rear working from checkout of git, w.o.w. path is relocatable (fix #53)

* Add bytes_per_inode information for ext* filesystem to layout.conf (fix #86)

* Fixing ebuild to be Gentoo compliant (fix #93)

* fix shutdown with upstart (fix #41)

* multiarch support library support (fix #82)

* Fix serial console on ubuntu 11.04 (fix #83)

* Several fixes in layout file (fix #85)

* Added fix for DAT320 tape drive (fix for #35)

* Use generic grub code for all distributions (fix for #77)

* list Xen paravirtualized disks in disklayout.conf (fixes #74 and SF3520992)

### Version 1.13.0 (April 2012)

* Support for multipathing was added

* Several improvements and bug fixes to the layout code (especially with parted backwards compatibility).

* Added support for ext4 file systems

* The OUTPUT=USB with BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP_PROG=rsync was corrected to avoid duplicate work

* Fedora and RHEL will now rebuild the initial ramdisk if needed (on recovered system)

* Fix for SF#3475480: datacompression on tape

* Fix for SF#3481656: missing bacula-console executable for BACKUP=BACULA workflow

* Fix for SF#3479570: /etc/passwd contains `:x:` without /etc/shadow

* Added "migrate HWADDR after cloning" code

* Improved the systemd code (parts required by Relax-and-Recover only) for Fedora 16/17

* The DHCLIENT variables were moved from local.conf to rescue.conf. This is done automatically, so the end-user, shouldnot be aware of it.

* At boot time more kernel options are recognized such as `noip`, `dhcp`,
  `debug`. The `noip` will give you a rescue environment without any attempt to
  start networking. The `dhcp` variable will try to start dhclient on any
  network interface it finds activated. The `debug` variable (which is not new
  by the way) will give you the chance to debug the code of our
  Relax-and-Recover code.

* Relax-and-Recover works again on IA64 architecture (at least with RHEL 5.x). Remember, RHEL 6 is not ported to IA64.



### Version 1.12.0 (November 2011)

* Multiple copies of Relax-and-Recover backups (of the same or different
  systems) can be kept on a USB device (with `OUTPUT=USB`).

* (*NEW!*) `BACKUP=RSYNC` workflow using `rsync` executable. Both `ssh` and `rsync` methods are supported. E.g.

        BACKUP=RSYNC
        OUTPUT=ISO
        BACKUP_URL=rsync://username@hostname/path
        BACKUP_PROG=/usr/local/bin/rsync #(instead of the default rsync)


* Added better named `EXCLUDE_` variables, better control over what is restored:
  - `EXCLUDE_BACKUP` excludes components from backup
  - `EXCLUDE_RECREATE` excludes components from the recreate process
  - `EXCLUDE_RESTORE` excludes components from the restore process

* The *layout* workflow is now the default instead of the *dr* workflow.  Under _/var/lib/rear/layout_ all information of the system is kept in files.

* Arch Linux is now supported with Relax-and-Recover.

* The `labeltape` command has been superseded by the `format` command. This can be used with tapes and external (USB, eSATA) devices. Usage:

        rear format [/dev/st0|/dev/sdx]


* Replaced `NETFS_URL` and `ISO_URL` by `BACKUP_URL` and `OUTPUT_URL`. However, old references will still be recognized and used.

* Fedora 16 is supported including GRUB 2, and systemd as init replacement.

* Added the `BACKUP_URL=file:///PATH` with `BACKUP=NETFS` method (as described in _configuration-examples.txt_)

* Improved multipath functionality

* Optional automatic autofs exclusion

* (*NEW! EXPERIMENTAL!*) Basic btrfs file system backup and restore works. Advise is not to trust it (yet). At recreation of the btrfs file system the UUID number is automatically renamed in all configuration files (such as _/etc/fstab_ or _/boot/grub/menu.lst_).


### Version 1.11.0 (May 2011)

* The `mkobdr` command has been removed. OBDR-enabled tapes can now be created using the `mkrescue` command and by defining the proper variables in _/etc/rear/local.conf_:

        BACKUP=NETFS
        OUTPUT=OBDR
        BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0


* The site configuration file _/etc/rear/site.conf_ has been removed from the
  Relax-and-Recover package, but can still be used if end-users want. The purpose of this
  is to enable sites to distribute this file through RPM or DEB packages that
  do not have a file conflict with the Relax-and-Recover package. The distribution
  _/etc/rear/local.conf_ file contains only configuration examples as comments
  in order to not interfere with configurations in _site.conf_.

* The `rear` command is by default quiet, which means if you want the same
  behavior as in previous versions you need to add the verbose option (`-v`)
  with the `rear` command

* The *output* workflow now runs before the *mkbackup* workflow especially done
  to make OBDR tape creation possible with the *mkbackup* workflow as the ISO
  image must be written first on an OBDR aware tape. Please note that this is
  a fundamental change with regard to previous versions of Relax-and-Recover.
  While utmost care has been taken that there would be no adverse side effects
  of this change. We cannot test all possible usage scenarios.

* When using `OUTPUT=USB` then you have to make sure that the destination (USB)
  disk is formatted as an ext2, ext3, ext4 or btrfs file-system. Extlinux is
  now the only supported boot loader for bootable disks, syslinux is not
  supported any more.

* The Relax-and-Recover boot now shows a boot menu with options to choose from.
  The actual content of the menu depends on the available syslinux version and
  its modules (like menu.c32, hdt.c32, reboot.c32, poweroff.com).

* Relax-and-Recover does properly recognize IPv6 addresses and uses these if
  configured.

* NBU backup method now allows to restore to a point in time.

* Support Fedora 15 (using systemd to boot-up) and RHEL6 and Scientific Linux 6.

* Improved handling of HP SmartArray controllers.

* Significantly improved error handling, especially when failing on subshells.

* Autologin as root in the rescue media (for upstart and systemd based systems).

* `EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS` should work correctly now (fixed typo).

* Support ext4 on RHEL5 and clones.

* Ignore known errors when using `EXTERNAL` backup method (set 
  `EXTERNAL_IGNORE_ERRORS` to an array of return codes to ignore).

* Use original filesystem mount options for recovery, support `attr` and `facl` tools.

* Support XEN paravirtualized systems (tested only on RHEL5 so far).

* Performance improvements (removed checksum calculation, PID-based locking).

* Relax-and-Recover work space is now created with a random part to prevent
  potential security exploits.

* Control exit tasks and subprocesses better. Kill subprocesses before exiting.

* Support adding Relax-and-Recover boot files to local GRUB environment
  (`GRUB_RESCUE`) and password protect rescue boot (`GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD`)
  to avoid accidential recovery.

  The default password is *REAR*.

* *(experimental!)* Transfer ISO image to remote URL (`ISO_URL`). Please note
  that this feature will be extended to cover all output methods. It has been
  renamed to `OUTPUT_URL`.

* Removed various warnings, e.g. about NETFS not being a professional backup
  method.

* Partial support for Arch Linux has been added, more testing required.

* (*NEW!*) shell workflow is now really usable.

* Make 32/64 bit handling much more robust, especially on systems having /lib32.

* NETFS backup and restore with rsync working now (`BACKUP_PROG=rsync`).

* Support udev on RHEL4.

* Development snapshot have now a version like 0.0.REV where REV is the SVN
  revision used to build the development snapshot.

* Greatly reduced log clutter (lvm warnings about leaked file descriptors,
  which is a bash bug, various irrelevant error and verbose output).

* checklayout can now also check arbitrary files (through an md5 checksum),
  extend the `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` array to use this feature.

### Version 1.10.0 (February 2011)
An intermediate release only which fixed some hanging issues of version 1.9.0.
Also, a RPM upgrade was fixed by this release from 1.7.25 to 1.9.0, which
failed because of a wrongly CentOS symbolic link. See
[bugzilla#680664](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=680664)


### Version 1.9.0 (February 2011)
With version 1.9.0 some new methods were added, such as:

* `rear mkobdr` : to create an OBDR recovery tape (obsolete since 1.11.0)

* `rear labeltape` : goes together with OBDR tapes. To avoid accidental
overwrites we force the creation of a label before `rear mkbackup` will
work. (obsolete since 1.11.0)

* `rear checklayout/savelayout` : a new method to save the disk layout
and check if a new `rear mkbackup` or `rear mkrescue` is required.

* New BACKUP methods were added, Bacula (`BACKUP=BACULA`) and bextract
(`BACKUP=BEXTRACT`), both are able to work in conjunction with
*output=TAPE*. See under the doc directory (or _/usr/share/doc/rear-1.9.0/_)
the _configuration-examples.txt_ text file for beginners instructions.

* `OUTPUT=USB` method has been extended with `BACKUP=NETFS` and
`NETFS_URL=usb:///dev/<device>` which makes it possible that the
complete archive is stored on the `/dev/<device>` and 
Relax-and-Recover will make the USB stick (or disk) bootable too.

* Udev support (except for some really ancient udev versions) which is the
base for many new and important features, like kernel drivers for network
cards and storage adapters are now loaded via udev, or deal with network
persistent names in udev rules, and firmware loading.

* DHCP client support (IPv4 and IPv6) has been added. Auto detection
is possible with new variable `USE_DHCLIENT=yes` (define in _local.conf_),
or one can hard-code your special DHCP client with the variables
`DHCLIENT_BIN` (for IPv4), and/or `DHCLIENT6_BIN` (for
IPv6).

Relax-and-Recover version 1.9.0 contain fixes for the following defects:

* Missing support for Scientific Linux, LinuxMint

* Sourceforge patch ID 2963804 - support for USBFS, but this patch has been
rewritten afterward to incorporate usb support into the NETFS backup method,
instead of having a separate USBFS backup method. Now, by using
`NETFS_URL=usb:///dev/<device>` and the NETFS backup method we achieve the
same result.

* Sourceforge bug 3153027 : support for RHEV virtio device files

* Novell bugzilla 581292 : cannot load NIC firmware because of missing udev
support.  Version 1.9 does have udev support, but firmware loading was
broken. The rule in 00-rear.rules has been changed.


### Version 1.7.26 (November 2010)
Relax-and-Recover version 1.7.26 fixed RedHat bugzilla defect 657174 : rescue
image freezes during the boot while executing init. This was due the new
upstart mechanism (replaced the sysv init procedure).


### Version 1.7.25 (June 2010)
Relax-and-Recover version 1.7.25 fixed RedHat bugzilla defect 600217 : Fedora
link missing in restore, pack and finalize sub-directories. This broke the
proper image building on several Fedora versions.


## System and Software Requirements
Relax-and-Recover works on GNU/Linux kernel with version 2.6 and higher.
For lower kernel versions Relax-and-Recover cannot be used, and for these
systems, [mkcdrec](http://mkcdrec.sourceforge.net/) is still a good
alternative.

As Relax-and-Recover has been solely written in the *bash* language we need
the bash shell which is standard available on all GNU/Linux based systems.
The default backup program Relax-and-Recover uses is GNU/tar which is also
standard available.

Relax-and-Recover is known to work well on x86 and x86_64 based architectures.
Relax-and-Recover has also been ported to ia64 and ppc architectures, but
these are less tested.  Use the '`rear validate`' command after every
successful DR test please and mail us the results.


### Choosing the best compression algorithm
The default backup program with Relax-and-Recover is (`BACKUP_PROG=tar`)
GNU tar and the default compression used with tar is `gzip`. However, is
using `gzip` the best choice? We have done some tests and published the
results. See
[Relax-and-Recover compression tests](http://www.it3.be/2013/09/16/NETFS-compression-tests/)


## Known Problems and Workarounds

*Issue Description*: Is there a possibility to add btrfs subvolume to a rsync backup

* Workaround:

At present (release 1.16.1) there is no workaround in place. If you happen to know how this could be fixed then add your ideas to [issue #417](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/417)

*Issue Description*: with RHEL 4 systems extended partitions are recognized as primary partitions

    Error: Expecting a partition number

* Workaround:

Full details can be read in [issue 314](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/319).
However, you need to edit `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file and change for
partition 4 "primary" to "extended"


*Issue Description*: System reconfiguration still has some weaknesses.

* this has to be tested before relying on it, there are too many unknowns
involved so that we cannot guarantee anything in this area. It has been
developed mostly as a P2V tool to migrate HP servers to VMware Vms

* hard disks need to be at least of the same size and amount as in the
original system, ATM this is a simple 1:1 mapping of old to new disks,
there is no removal of RAID groups or merging of smaller disks onto a
bigger one or making stuff smaller.

* any use of _/dev/disk/by-path_ or _/dev/disk/by-id_ is untested and will
most likely not work. In some cases Relax-and-Recover will print a warning,
but we are not able to detect all cases. Typically this leads to unbootable
systems or bad _/etc/fstab_ files

*Issue Description*: The DHCP client is still a little rough around the edges,
especially with complex networking scenarios.

*Issue Description*: An error is encountered while upgrading rear-1.7.* to
rear-1.9.0:

    error: unpacking of archive failed on file /usr/share/rear/finalize/CentOS: cpio: rename failed - Is a directory


* Workaround:

First remove the older Relax-and-Recover version by hand and then install
the new version. The _local.conf_ is saved (as _local.conf.rpmsave_) when
we execute `rpm -e rear`


*Issue Description*: If SELinux is not disabled during backup (variable
`BACKUP_SELINUX_DISABLE=` in _/etc/rear/local.conf_) then we might see
errors in the `rear-$(hostname).log` file such as:

    tar: var/cache/yum/i386/15/updates/packages: Cannot setfilecon: No such file or directory

* Workaround:

Make sure the `BACKUP_URL` destination understands extended attributes
(CIFS is out of the question and NFS is problematic). When using local
disks (or external USB devices) make sure the proper mount options are
given in the `BACKUP_OPTIONS` variable, e.g.:


    BACKUP_OPTIONS="rw,relatime,seclabel,user_xattr,acl,barrier=1,data=ordered"


(TIP) `BACKUP_SELINUX_DISABLE=1` variable has been introduced in the
_/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf_ file to disable SELinux
while the backup is running (default setting).

*Issue Description*: Is incremental backup possible? With our default
settings (`BACKUP=NETFS` and `BACKUP_PROG=tar`) we do not yet support
incremental backups.

* Workaround:

However, when we change `BACKUP_PROG=rsync` we can use `rear mkbackuponly`
option which is in fact an incremental backup using the `rsync` program.
The same can be accomplished by using `BACKUP=RSYNC` and the proper
`BACKUP_URL=rsync://hostname/PATH`.

*Issue Description*: Error "Missing usr/lib/systemd/system - too confused to continue"

Above error message might be seen after upgrading rear from a very old version (like rear-1.10) to the latest one.

* Workaround:

Use the command `rpm -V rear` to verify the upgrade went fine. If not, then remove first the old version (with `rpm -e rear`) before installing the latest version.

*Issue Description*: ERROR: FindStorageDrivers called but STORAGE_DRIVERS is empty

Above error message might be seen after a fresh installation of the GNU/Linux kernel. Rear got confused between the running kernel version number and the actual fresh kernel available.

* Workaround:

Reboot your server before using rear again, which is a good practice anyway after upgrading the GNU/Linux kernel.
