# Usually functions belong to the library scripts (i.e. $SHARE_DIR/lib/*.sh),
# but these 2 are exceptions on the rule because the complementary global functions
# to get and apply bash flags and options commands are needed from the very beginning
# (the usual functions are sourced at "Include functions" below):
function get_bash_flags_and_options_commands () {
    # Output bash commands that set the currently set flags
    # in reverse ordering to have "set ... xtrace" (i.e. "set +/- x") first
    # so that this flag is set first via apply_bash_flags_and_options_commands
    # which results better matching logging output in debugscripts mode:
    set +o | tac | tr '\n' ';'
    # Output bash commands that set the currently set options:
    shopt -p | tr '\n' ';'
}
# This function exists only to provide a syntactically matching counterpart of get_bash_flags_and_options_commands:
function apply_bash_flags_and_options_commands () {
    # Must be called with $1 that is the output of a previous get_bash_flags_and_options_commands:
    eval "$1"
}
# At the very beginning save initial bash flags and options in a global readonly variable
# so that exactly the initial bash flags and options can be restored if needed via
#   apply_bash_flags_and_options_commands "$INITIAL_BASH_FLAGS_AND_OPTIONS_COMMANDS"
