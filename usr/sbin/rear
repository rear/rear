# Enable as needed for development of fail-safe code:
# set -xvue -o pipefail
# set -ue -o pipefail
# Cf. the Relax-and-Recover Coding Style
# https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style
# that reads (excerpt - dated 18. Nov. 2015):
# "TODO Use set -eu to die from unset variables and unhandled errors"

# The complementary global functions to get and apply bash flags and options commands
# are needed from the very beginning:
function GetBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands () {
    # Output bash commands that set the currently set flags:
    set +o | tr '\n' ';'
    # Output bash commands that set the currently set options:
    shopt -p | tr '\n' ';'
}
# This function exists only to provide a syntactically matching counterpart of GetBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands:
function ApplyBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands () {
    # Must be called with $1 that is the output of a previous GetBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands call:
    eval "$1"
}
# At the very beginning save initial bash flags and options in a global readonly variable
# so that exactly the initial bash flags and options can be restored if needed via
#   ApplyBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands "$INITIAL_FLAGS_AND_OPTIONS_SETTING_COMMANDS"
