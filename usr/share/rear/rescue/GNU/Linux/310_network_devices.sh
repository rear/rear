# Where to build networking configuration.
# When booting the rescue/recovery system
# /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh
# is run to setup the network devices:
network_devices_setup_script=$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

# This script (rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh) is intended to
# autogenerate network devices setup code in the network_devices_setup_script
# according to the network devices setup in the currently running system
# to get an automated network devices setup in the rescue/recovery system
# that matches the network devices setup in the currently running system.
# This 310_network_devices.sh script should always run completely until its end
# to achieve that the network_devices_setup_script contains autogenerated code
# for a complete network devices setup that matches the currently running system.
# Therefore the autogenerated code in the network_devices_setup_script
# can return early or skip parts as needed but the network_devices_setup_script
# should always contain all code for the complete network devices setup.
# This way the network_devices_setup_script in the rescue/recovery system
# is intended to provide code for a complete network devices setup so that
# if needed the user can adapt and enhance the network_devices_setup_script
# and run it again as needed in the rescue/recovery system, cf.
