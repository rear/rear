Features:   tar backup to external USB harddisk
Comment:    We had to manually include btrfs subvolumes in local.conf with 
            BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE; Rest of backup process worked out of the box; 
            Restore process: The default target disk proposed by rear recover 
            was the boot disk (same size as system disk that was archived) with 
            the backup file and rescue system on it. Without interfering 
            manually the rescue media is destroyed (We tested once and it 
            was...); Second attempt the target disk (empty, new ssd with 
            different size as origninal disk) was chosen manually during 
            the restore process and it finished with a bootable system without 
            any further problems;
