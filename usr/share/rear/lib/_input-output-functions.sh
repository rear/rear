    # That USR1 has a trap (see above) that does 'kill MASTER_PID' whicht triggers another trap on EXIT that calls DoExitTasks().

    #   ( echo "additional content for file" || Error "failed to append content to file" ) >> file
    # the Error function does not let MASTER_PID exit because the parent shell waits until its subshell has finished
    # so that the USR1 that was sent above to MASTER_PID will be processed only after the subshell has finished
    # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2089#issuecomment-474260332 that reads (excerpts)
    #    A nice clean reproducer on plain command line (needs a recent bash that supports BASHPID):
    #       # export MASTERPID=$BASHPID
    #       # trap "echo $MASTERPID got USR1" USR1
    #       # ( echo begin subshell $BASHPID parent $MASTERPID
    #           pstree -Aplau $MASTERPID
    #           kill -USR1 $MASTERPID
    #           echo sent USR1 to $MASTERPID in subshell
    #           echo other stuff in subshell
    #           echo subshell done )
    #    Running that reproducer results:
    #       begin subshell 26109 parent 26108
    #       bash,26108
    #         `-bash,26109
    #             `-pstree,26110 -Aplau 26108
    #       sent USR1 to 26108 in subshell
    #       other stuff in subshell
    #       subshell done
    #       26108 got USR1
    #   It shows that the parent waits until its subshell child has finished and then the parent processes the signal.
    #   This behaviour matches what "man bash" reads for "SIGNALS":
    #      If bash is waiting for a command to complete
    #      and receives a signal for which a trap has been set,
    #      the trap will not be executed until the command completes.
    # This means when the Error function is called from within a subshell only USR1 is sent to MASTER_PID
    # and the subshell continues with all its code after the Error function until the subshell finishes.
    # This would result unintendedly executed code (with all its unexpected messages in the log file) and
    # also further Error function calls with error messages on the user's terminal from subsequent failures
    # after the initial error, e.g. see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087#issue-421604286 that shows
    #   ERROR: Partition number '0' of partition mmcblk0boot0 is not a valid number.
    #   ERROR: Partition number '' of partition mmcblk0rpmb is not a valid number.
    #   ERROR: Partition mmcblk0rpmb is numbered ''. More than 128 partitions is not supported.
    #   Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-testvm02.log for details
    # where only the first error message should have been shown and a direct abort should have happened.
    # This is the reason why we have to terminate all still running descendant processes of MASTER_PID
    # but do not terminate the MASTER_PID process itself because the MASTER_PID process must run
    # the exit tasks via DoExitTasks via trap on EXIT via trap on USR1 (see above).
    # How to cleanly error out from within a lower level of nested subshells as in this code:
    #   ( LogPrint "Begin first subshell"
    #     ( LogPrint "Begin second subshell"
    #       Error "First error"
    #       Error "Second error"
    #       LogPrint "End second subshell"
    #     )
    #     LogPrint "Code in first subshell after second subshell"
    #     LogPrint "End of first subshell"
    #   )
    # It should error out at "First error" and not execute any code after that.
    # If we terminate the second subshell here (i.e. the one that currently runs this 'Error "First error"' function)
    # we could avoid that the second subshell unintendedly continues and runs the 'Error "Second error"' function
    # but its parent (i.e. the first subshell that has waited for its second subshell child to finish)
    # would then continue and unintendedly execute the "Code in first subshell after second subshell".

# The ...IfError functions should no longer be used in new code and
# when existing code is modified the existing ...IfError functions
# should be replaced by using bash directly (see the examples below).
#
# Reason:
# Using the ...IfError functions can result unexpected behaviour in certain cases.
#
# Examples:
#
# Using $? in an ...IfError function message like
#   COMMAND
#   StopIfError "COMMAND failed with error code $?"
# lets $? evaluate to an unintended value (usually 0) for example as in
#   # cat QQQ ; if (( $? != 0 )) ; then echo "ERROR $?" ; fi
#   cat: QQQ: No such file or directory
#   ERROR 0
# In contrast using bash directly as in
#   # cat QQQ || echo "ERROR $?"
#   cat: QQQ: No such file or directory
#   ERROR 1
# works as expected.
# By the way:
# Using $? with 'if ! ...' like
#   if ! COMMAND ; then echo "COMMAND failed with $?" ; fi
# does not work because '!' changes/inverts '$?' for example as in
#   # if ! cat QQQ ; then echo "cat QQQ failed with $?" ; fi
#   cat: QQQ: No such file or directory
#   cat QQQ failed with 0
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2985#issuecomment-1545455356
# so one should avoid 'if ! ...' like
#   if COMMAND ; then ... ; else echo "COMMAND failed with $?" ; fi
# for example as in
#   # if cat QQQ ; then : ; else echo "cat QQQ failed with $?" ; fi
#   cat: QQQ: No such file or directory
#   cat QQQ failed with 1
#
# The ...IfError functions fail when 'set -e' is set
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/534
# for example code like
#   set -e
#   COMMAND
#   StopIfError "COMMAND failed"
# cannot work because 'set -e' exits the script when COMMAND results non-zero exit code
# so that the subsequent StopIfError is never reached.
# In contrast using bash directly as in
#   set -e
#   COMMAND || Error "COMMAND failed"
# works as expected.
#
# The ...IfError functions fail when $( COMMAND )
# command substitution is used in the ...IfError functions message
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1415#issuecomment-315692391
# for example code like
#   COMMAND1
#   StopIfError "... $( COMMAND2 ) ..."
# cannot work because $? that is tested in the ...IfError functions
# will be the one from COMMAND2 and not the one from COMMAND1
# so that StopIfError errors out when COMMAND2 fails but not when COMMAND1 fails.
# In contrast using bash directly as in
#   COMMAND1 || Error "... $( COMMAND2 ) ..."
# works as expected when $? is not used in the Error function message.
# When $? should be used in the Error function message it must be before $( COMMAND2 ).
# When $? is before $( COMMAND2 ) it evaluates to the exit code of COMMAND1.
# When $? is after $( COMMAND2 ) it evaluates to the exit code of COMMAND2.
# At least with bash-4.4 in openSUSE Leap 15.1 one gets
#   # cat QQQ || echo "ERROR $? $( grep -Q '/' /etc/fstab ) $?" 
#   cat: QQQ: No such file or directory
#   grep: invalid option -- 'Q'
#   Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
#   Try 'grep --help' for more information.
#   ERROR 1  2
# when COMMAND1 fails with exit code 1 and COMMAND2 fails with exit code 2
# versus
#   # cat QQQ || echo "ERROR $? $( grep -q '/' /etc/fstab ) $?" 
#   cat: QQQ: No such file or directory

# UserInput is a general function that is intended for basically any user input.
#   Output happens via the original STDOUT and STDERR when 'rear' was launched
#   (which is usually the terminal of the user who launched 'rear') and
#   input is read from the original STDIN when 'rear' was launched
#   (which is usually the keyboard of the user who launched 'rear').
# Synopsis:
#   UserInput -I user_input_ID [-C] [-r] [-s] [-t timeout] [-p prompt] [-a input_words_array_name] [-n input_max_chars] [-d input_delimiter] [-D default_input] [choices]
#   The options -r -s -t -p -a -n -d  match the ones for the 'read' bash builtin.
#   The option [choices] are the values that are shown to the user as available choices like if a 'select' bash keyword was used.
#   The option [-D default_input] specifies what is used as default response when the user does not enter something.
#       Usually this is one of the choice values or one of the a choice numbers '1' '2' '3' ...
#       that are shown to the user (the choice numbers are shown as in 'select' (i.e. starting at 1)
#       but the default input can be anything else (in particular for free input without predefined choices)
#       so that e.g. '-D 0' is not the first choice but lets the default input be '0' (regardless of choices).
#   The option '-I user_input_ID' is required so that UserInput can work full automated (e.g. when ReaR runs unattended)
#       via user-specified variables that get named USER_INPUT_user_input_ID (i.e. prefixed with 'USER_INPUT_')
#       so that the user can (as he needs it) predefine user input values like
#           USER_INPUT_FOO_CONFIRMATION='input for UserInput -I FOO_CONFIRMATION'
#           USER_INPUT_BAR_CHOICE='input for UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE'
#           USER_INPUT_BAZ_DIALOG='input for UserInput -I BAZ_DIALOG'
#           (with actually meaningful words for FOO, BAR, and BAZ)
#       that will be autoresponded with the value of the matching USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variable.
#       Accordingly only a valid variable name can be used as user_input_ID value.
#       Different UserInput calls must use different '-I user_input_ID' option values but
#       same UserInput calls in different scripts can use same '-I user_input_ID' option values.
#       It is recommended to use meaningful and explanatory user_input_ID values
#       which helps the user to specify automated input via meaningful USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variables
#       and it avoids that different UserInput calls accidentally use same user_input_ID values.
#       It is required to use uppercase user_input_ID values because the USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variables
#       are user configuration variables and all user configuration variables have uppercase letters.
#   The option [-C] specifies confidential user input mode. In this mode no input values are logged.
#       This means that neither the actual user input nor the default input nor the choices values are logged but
#       the prompt, the actual input, the default value, and the choices are still shown on the user's terminal.
#       In confidential user input mode the actual input coming from the user's terminal is still echoed
#       on the user's terminal unless also the -s option is specified.
#       When usr/sbin/rear is run in debugscript mode (which runs the scripts with 'set -x') arbitrary values
#       appear in the log file so that the confidential user input mode does not help in debugscript mode.
#       If confidential user input is needed also in debugscript mode the caller of the UserInput function
#       must call it in an appropriate (temporary) environment e.g. with STDERR redirected to /dev/null like
#           { password="$( UserInput -I PASSWORD -C -r -s -p 'Enter the pasword' )" ; } 2>/dev/null
#       or since https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006 probably better as
#           { password="$( UserInput -I PASSWORD -C -r -s -p 'Enter the pasword' )" ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV
#       to still make debugging possible for the user by calling rear with the --expose-secrets option.
#       The redirection must be done via a compound group command like
#           { confidential_command ; } 2>/dev/null
#       even for a single confidential command to ensure STDERR is redirected to /dev/null also for 'set -x'
#       otherwise the confidential command and its arguments would be shown in the log file, for example
#           { openssl des3 -salt -k secret_passphrase ; } 2>/dev/null
#       where the secret passphrase must not appear in the log,
#       cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2155
#       and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967
# Result:
#   Any actual user input or an automated user input or the default response is output via STDOUT.
# Return code:
#   The UserInput return code is the return code of the 'read' bash builtin that is called to get user input.
#   When the UserInput function is called with right syntax its return code is 0
#   for any actual user input and in case of any (non empty) automated user input.
#   The return code is 1 when the 'read' call timed out (i.e. when there was no actual user input)
#   so that one can distinguish between an explicitly provided user input and no actual user input
#   even if the explicitly provided user input is the same as the default so that it makes a difference
#   whether or not the user explicitly chose and confirmed that the default is what he actually wants
#   or if he let things "just happen" inattentively via timeout where it is important to have a big timeout
#   so that an attentive user will actively provide user input to proceed even if it is same as the default.
# Usage examples:
# * Wait endlessly until the user hits the [Enter] key (without '-t 0' a default timeout is used):
#       UserInput -I WAIT_UNTIL_ENTER -t 0 -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
# * Wait up to 30 seconds until the user hits the [Enter] key (i.e. proceed automatically after 30 seconds):
#       UserInput -I WAIT_FOR_ENTER_OR_TIMEOUT -t 30 -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
# * Get an input value from the user (proceed automatically with empty input_value after the default timeout).
#   Leading and trailing spaces are cut from the actual user input:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I FOO_INPUT -p 'Enter the input value' )"
# * Get an input value from the user (proceed automatically with the 'default input' after 2 minutes).
#   The timeout interrupts ongoing user input so that 'default input' is used when the user
#   does not hit the [Enter] key to finish his input before the timeout happens:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I FOO_INPUT -t 120 -p 'Enter the input value' -D 'default input' )"
# * Get an input value from the user by offering him possible choices (proceed with the default choice after the default timeout).
#   The shown choice numbers start with 1 so that '-D 2' specifies the second choice as default choice:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE -p 'Select a choice' -D 2 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' )"
# * When the user enters an arbitrary value like 'foo bar' this actual user input is used as input_value.
#   The UserInput function provides the actual user input and its caller needs to check the actual user input.
#   To enforce that the actual user input is one of the choices an endless retrying loop could be used like:
#       choices=( 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' )
#       until IsInArray "$input_value" "${choices[@]}" ; do
#           input_value="$( UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE -p 'Select a choice' -D 'second choice' "${choices[@]}" )"
#       done
#   Because the default choice is one of the choices the endless loop does not contradict that ReaR can run unattended.
#   When that code runs unattended (i.e. without actual user input) the default choice is used after the default timeout.
# * The default choice can be anything as in:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE -p 'Select a choice' -D 'fallback value' -n 1 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' )"
#   The caller needs to check the actual input_value which could be 'fallback value' when the user hits the [Enter] key
#   or one of 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' when the user hits the [1] [2] or [3] key respectively
#   or any other character as actual user input ('-n 1' limits the actual user input to one single character).
# * When up to 9 possible choices are shown using '-n 1' lets the user choose one by only pressing a [1] ... [9] key
#   without the additional [Enter] key that is normally needed to submit the input. With an endless loop that retries
#   when the actual user input is not one of the choices it is possible to implement valid and convenient user input:
#       choices=( 'default choice' 'first alternative choice' 'second alternative choice' )
#       until IsInArray "$choice" "${choices[@]}" ; do
#           choice="$( UserInput -I BAZ_CHOICE -t 60 -p 'Hit a choice number key' -D 1 -n 1 "${choices[@]}" )"
#       done
# * To to let UserInput autorespond full automated a predefined user input value specify the user input value
#   with a matching USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variable (e.g. specify that it in your local.conf file) like
#       USER_INPUT_BAR_CHOICE='third choice'
#   which lets a 'UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE' call autorespond with 'third choice'.
#   No USER_INPUT_BAR_CHOICE variable should exist to get real user input for a 'UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE' call
#   or the user can interupt any automated response within a relatively short time (minimum is only 1 second).
# * The non-interactive feature works by erroring out in UserInput if the same user input ID is used more than once and
#   if the first call to UserInput was not met by a human response. The idea is that if the first call ran into the
#   timeout then the second call will not have a better chance of success and should be treated as an error.
#   That way, ReaR will quickly abort in situations where human intervention is required but not provided.
#   This is implemented via the Bash array USER_INPUT_SEEN_WITH_TIMEOUT which tracks which user input IDs
#   were already used and ran into the timeout.

    # to avoid that when the user had accidentally hit ENTER more than once in a previous (UserInput) dialog
    # then those additional ENTER characters would be already in stdin and let this current UserInput dialog

    # There is no generic and fail safe working way to clear stdin
    # cf. https://superuser.com/questions/276531/clear-stdin-before-reading
    # so we 'read' and discard what is already there up to 1000 characters
    # which leaves characters in stdin if there are more than 1000 characters in stdin.
    # It does not get unfinished lines in the terminal buffer which are not yet in stdin.
    # Draining also the terminal buffer would require special things with 'stty' like
    #   old_tty_settings=$( stty -g )
    #   stty -icanon min 0 time 0

    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2866#issuecomment-1254908270
