### Functions for dealing with URLs
######
# URL is the most common form of URI
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier
# where a generic URI is usually of the form
# scheme://[[user:password@]host[:port]]/path[?query][#fragment]
# e.g. for BACKUP_URL=sshfs://user@host/G/rear/
# url_scheme = 'sshfs' , url_host = 'user@host' , url_hostname = 'host' , url_username = 'user' , url_path = '/G/rear/'
# e.g. for BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1
# url_scheme = 'usb' , url_host = '' , url_hostname = '' , url_username = '' , url_path = '/dev/sdb1'
# TODO: the url_* functions do not support the minimal scheme:path case of an URL
# for example
#   # url='mailto:John.Doe@example.com'
#   # url_scheme "$url"
#   rsync
#   # url_host "$url"
#   mailto:John.Doe@example.com
#   # url_hostname "$url"
#   example.com
#   # url_username "$url"
#   mailto
#   # url_password "$url"
#   John.Doe
#   # url_path "$url"
#   /mailto:John.Doe@example.com
# FIXME: the ulr_* functions are not safe against special characters
# for example they break when the password contains spaces
# but on the other hand permitted characters for values in a URI
# are ASCII letters, digits, dot, hyphen, underscore, and tilde
# and any other character must be percent-encoded (in particular the
# characters : / ? # [ ] @ are reserved as delimiters of URI components
# and must be percent-encoded when used in the value of a URI component)
# so that what is missing is support for percent-encoded characters
# but user-friendly support for percent-encoded characters is not possible

# Therefore one cannot use the mathlib_calculate ()

# With bash arithmetic expansion
#   # start=123456
#   # echo $(( $start % 4096 ))

# But will fail with mathlib_calculate ()
