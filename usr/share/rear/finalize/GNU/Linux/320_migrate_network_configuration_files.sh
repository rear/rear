# This script finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh
# rewrites some network configuration files (cf. network_configuration_files below)

# as specified in the mapping files
#   /etc/rear/mappings/mac
#   /etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses
#   /etc/rear/mappings/routes
# in the currently running ReaR recovery system.
# In particular /etc/rear/mappings/mac gets automatically created during recovery system startup
# via [usr/share/rear/skel/default]/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh
# if the original interface MAC is not found in the currently running recovery system
# so rewriting of MAC addresses happens usually automatically on replacement hardware.

# All finalize scripts that patch restored files within TARGET_FS_ROOT
# should do the same directory and file and symlink handling which means:
# 0. Skip patching non-regular files like directories, device nodes, or files that do not exist
# When the regular file is a symlink:
# 1. Try to patch the symlink target when the regular file is a symlink
# 2. Skip patching if the symlink target contains /proc/ /sys/ /dev/ or /run/
# 3. Skip patching symlink targets that are non-regular files like directories, device nodes, or files that do not exist
# 4. Skip patching dead symlinks
# See the symlink handling code in finalize/GNU/Linux/280_migrate_uuid_tags.sh and other such files,
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055 and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1338
