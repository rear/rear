# restore data with Galaxy
#
# Note:
# GxCmd checks for $# and calls the GxCmdLine script if there are any cmdline args.
# due to the way we call our scripts (with . ), the script name is present in $1
# So, in order to make GxCmd work correctly, we have to clear $*, but to be correct we
# restore $* at the end of this script, even though it probably really doesn't matter.
#
# Galaxy also seems to mess with STDERR, so that after this script nothing came to the logfile
# Putting the Galaxy restore in a subshell with () tries to cage Galaxy somewhat.
