#       checkout build with the regular configuration

# Copy ReaR configuration directory:
mkdir $v -p $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear
# This will do same job as lines below.
# On top of that, it does not throw log warning like:
# "cp: missing destination file operand after"
# if hidden file (.<filename>) is missing in $CONFIG_DIR.
# To avoid dangling symlinks copy the content of the symlink target via '-L'
# which could lead to same content that exists in two independent regular files but
# for configuration files there is no other option than copying dereferenced files
# since files in $CONFIG_DIR specified with '-c /path' get copied into '/etc/rear'
# in the ReaR recovery system, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1923

# The basic deduplication algorithm that is used here is to 'printf' each COPY_AS_IS element
# on a separated line (i.e. this algorithm fails when elements contain newline characters)
# and then filter those lines by 'awk' that outputs only the first occurrence of a line.
# To remove duplicate lines and keep the ordering one could use ... | cat -n | sort -uk2 | sort -nk1 | cut -f2-
# cf. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11532157/remove-duplicate-lines-without-sorting/11532197#11532197
# that also explains an awk command that prints each line provided the line was not seen before.
# The awk variable $0 holds an entire line and square brackets is associative array access in awk.
# For each line the node of the associative array 'seen' is incremented and the line is printed
# if the content of that node was not '!' previously set (i.e. if the line was not previously seen)

    # A new temporary array is used to store the deduplicated elements for two reasons:

    # the intermediate array is used to test if the deduplication result looks right:

# If the deduplication result does not look reasonable keep using the unchanged COPY_AS_IS
# also keep using the unchanged COPY_AS_IS when there was no duplicate element
# which avoids a useless copy of the copy_as_is_without_duplicates array to COPY_AS_IS.
# The hardcoded condition that copy_as_is_without_duplicates contains more than 100 elements
# is based on the finding that usually COPY_AS_IS has about 130 elements without duplicates
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2377#issuecomment-618301702
# so if deduplication results less than 100 elements things look fishy (possibly falsely removed elements)
# and then we fall back using the original COPY_AS_IS because things still work
# when we let 'tar' needlessly copy duplicated things several times:

#  # echo foo >foo ; echo baz >baz ; tar -cvf archive.tar foo bar baz ; echo $? ; tar -tvf archive.tar
