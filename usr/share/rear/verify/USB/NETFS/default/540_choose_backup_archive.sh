# In case of backup restore from USB let the user choose which backup will be restored.

# When USB_SUFFIX is set the compliance mode is used where
# backup on USB works in compliance with backup on NFS which means
# a fixed backup directory where the user cannot choose the backup
# because what there is in the fixed backup directory will be restored
# via RESTORE_ARCHIVES set by usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh
# Use plain $USB_SUFFIX and not "$USB_SUFFIX" because when USB_SUFFIX contains only blanks
# test "$USB_SUFFIX" would result true because test " " results true:
test $USB_SUFFIX && return

# When backup on USB works in its default mode with several timestamp backup directories
# let the user choose the backup regardless whether or not RESTORE_ARCHIVES
# is already set by usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh
# because when the user has created a backup plus recovery system via "rear mkbackup"
# and afterwards a newer backup without recovery system via "rear mkbackuponly"
# then the recovery system directory contains the (older) backup and that one gets
# set in RESTORE_ARCHIVES by usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh
# but probably the user wants to choose the newer backup to be actually restored.

# Detect all backups on the USB device.
# TODO: This fails when the backup archive name is not
# ${BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE}${BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX}${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX}
# so that in particular it fails for incremental/differential backups
# but incremental/differential backups usually require several backup archives
# to be restored (one full backup plus one differential or several incremental backups)
# cf. RESTORE_ARCHIVES in usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh
# and the backup selection code below only works to select one single backup archive:
