# Examples how '/' could be missing in backup-include.txt:
# - When BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE or MANUAL_INCLUDE is set
#   the user may not have added '/' to BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE
#   so the '/' mountpoint will not be written into backup-include.txt
# - When '/' is on a multipath device the default AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=y
#   will automatically exclude '/' and dependent components
#   so '/' is not in var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint_device

#   and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189#issuecomment-2082981807
