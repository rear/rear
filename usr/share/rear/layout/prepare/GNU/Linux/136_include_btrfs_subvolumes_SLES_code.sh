        # Remounting is needed when at the '/' mountpoint not the btrfs default subvolume is mounted:
        # On Fedora 21 what is mounted at the root of the filesystem tree (i.e. at the '/' mountpoint)
        # is not the btrfs default subvolume (the default subvolume is the toplevel/root subvolume).
        # On Fedora 21 there is a btrfs subvolume "root" which is mounted at the '/' mountpoint.
        # I (jsmeix@suse.de) am not a btrfs expert but from my point of view it looks like
        # a misconfiguration (a.k.a. bug) in Fedora 21 how they set up btrfs. I think Fedora
        # should specify as btrfs default subvolume what is mounted by default at the '/' mountpoint.
        # On the other hand I noticed an openSUSE user who presented arguments that
        # the btrfs default subvolume setting only belongs to the user and
        # should not be used by the system to specify what is mounted by default,
        # see what Chris Murphy wrote on the "Default btrfs subvolume after a rollback"
        # and "systemd, btrfs, /var/lib/machines" mail threads on opensuse-factory@opensuse.org
        # http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-07/msg00517.html
        # http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-07/msg00591.html
        # and his GitHub snapper issue and openSUSE feature request
        # "snapper improperly usurps control of the default subvolume from the user"

        # Regardless who or what is right or wrong here I like to have ReaR working fail-safe
        # because an admin could manually create any kind of awkward btrfs setup.
        # Therefore remounting is needed when the subvolume_mountpoint is '/'
        # but the subvolume_path is neither '/' nor the default subvolume.
        # Examples: disklayout.conf contains
        # on openSUSE 13.2 at '/' the default subvolume which is the root subvolume (ID 5 '/') is mounted:
        #   btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda2 / 5 /
        #   btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 / rw,relatime,space_cache /
        # on SLES 12 at '/' the default subvolume '@' is mounted:
        #   btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda2 / 257 @
        #   btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 / rw,relatime,space_cache @
        # on SLES 12 SP1 at '/' the default subvolume '@/.snapshots/1/snapshot' is mounted:
        #   btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda2 / 259 @/.snapshots/1/snapshot
        #   #btrfssnapshotsubvol /dev/sda2 / 259 @/.snapshots/1/snapshot
        #   btrfsnormalsubvol /dev/sda2 / 258 @/.snapshots
        #   btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 / rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=259,subvol=/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot @/.snapshots/1/snapshot
        # on Fedora 21 at '/' not the default subvolume which is the root subvolume (ID 5 '/') but the subvolume 'root' is mounted:
        #   btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda3 / 5 /
        #   btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda3 / rw,relatime,seclabel,space_cache root
        # FIXME: Currently only for the mountpoint '/' there is this special handling.
        # In general the subvolume_mountpoint could be anything.
        # For example for a second disk /dev/sdb1 the disklayout.conf file could contain those entries:
        #   btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sdb1 /data 5 /
        #   btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sdb1 /data rw,relatime,seclabel,space_cache datasubvol
        # This would mean for /dev/sdb1 what is mounted at its mountpoint /data
        # is not its btrfs default subvolume but the btrfs subvolume "datasubvol".
