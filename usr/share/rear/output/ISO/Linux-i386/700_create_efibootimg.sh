# Calculate exact size of EFI virtual image (efiboot.img):
# Get size of directory holding EFI virtual image content.
# The virtual image must be aligned to 32MiB blocks
# therefore the size of directory is measured in 32MiB blocks.
# The du output is stored in an artificial bash array
# so that $efi_img_sz can be simply used to get the first word
# which is the disk usage of the directory measured in 32MiB blocks:

# We add 2 more 32MiB blocks to be on the safe side against inexplicable failures like
# "cp: error writing '/var/tmp/rear.XXX/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/...': No space left on device"

# - Some firmwares fail to boot from small FAT32 partitions.
# - Some firmwares fail to boot from FAT16 partitions.
