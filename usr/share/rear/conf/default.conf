# Relax-and-Recover default configuration.

#
#
# Here we define and describe all configuration variables and set them to a default.
#
# Do not change them here. Set them in your site.conf or local.conf file as needed.
#
# Some variables are actually bash arrays and should be treated with care.
# Use VAR=() to set an empty array.
# Use VAR=( "${VAR[@]}" 'value' ) to add a fixed value to an array.
# Use VAR=( "${VAR[@]}" "$var" ) to add a variable value to an array.
# Whether or not the latter case works as intended depends on when and
# how "$var" is set and evaluated by the Relax-and-Recover scripts.
# In general using ${VAR[*]} is problematic and using ${VAR[@]} without
# double-quotes is also problematic, see 'Arrays' in "man bash" and
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068 for some examples.
#
# Most variables can be set to an empty value VAR= which means that this
# setting is off or set to some automatic mode.
#
# Boolean variables can be set to anything as we only check whether the variable
# is not empty so that both VAR=yes and VAR=no evaluate to boolean 'true'.
# To set a boolean variable to 'false' set it to an empty value.
#
# A few variables have ternary semantics:
# - explicit true value like True T true t Yes Y yes y 1
# - explicit false value like False F false f No N no n 0
# - unset or empty or a value that is neither a true value nor a false value
# (see the is_true and is_false functions in lib/global-functions.sh).
#
# In case of doubt inspect the scripts how exactly a particular variable works.

##
# TMPDIR
#
# Relax-and-Recover needs a (temporary) working area where it builds in particular
# the rescue/recovery system ISO image (and perhaps even stores the backup archive).
# The directory name of the working area is created in /usr/sbin/rear by calling
#   mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# which usually results /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX or $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# the latter when the canonical Linux/Unix environment variable TMPDIR
# is set in the environment where /usr/sbin/rear is called.
# To have a specific working area directory prefix for Relax-and-Recover
# specify in /etc/rear/local.conf something like
#   export TMPDIR="/prefix/for/rear/working/directory"
# where /prefix/for/rear/working/directory must already exist.
# This is useful for example when there is not sufficient free space
# in /tmp or $TMPDIR for the ISO image or even the backup archive.
# TMPDIR cannot be set to a default value here, otherwise /usr/sbin/rear
# would not work in compliance with the Linux/Unix standards regarding TMPDIR
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968

# You can override autodetection and specify the kernel for the rescue/recovery system:
KERNEL_FILE=""
# The kernel configuration is used to collect the kernel binary and modules.
# It can be set to a different version (e.g. to create a UP rescue media on a SMP system):
KERNEL_VERSION="${KERNEL_VERSION:-$( uname -r )}"
# You can add arbitrary kernel command line parameters when booting the rescue/recovery system
# as you need it (e.g. things like 'console=...' see USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE below).
# Additionally Relax-and-Recover supports the following special kernel command line parameters:
# - 'debug' starts all init-scripts (in /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/ in the rescue/recovery system)
#   in debug mode (via 'set -x') and asks for confirmation before it runs each init-script
#   so that you can skip a script if needed.
# - 'noip' prevents initialization of the networking configuration which is useful when
#   you want to do the networking configuration manually in the rescue/recovery system
#   e.g. to prevent the rescue/recovery system to use the same IP address as the original system
#   but for the latter using USE_DHCLIENT="yes" (see below) is probably easier:

# Relax-and-Recover recovery system update during "rear recover"
#
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841
# and https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects/1508
#
# The by default empty RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL means this functionality is not used so that
# "rear recover" runs as usual without updating any files in the ReaR recovery system
# (i.e. with the recovery system as "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue" had made it).
#
# If RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL is non-empty it points to a download location
# wherefrom "rear recover" will first of all download a tar.gz archive and
# extract that at the root directory '/' in the ReaR recovery system.
#
# The intended purpose is to download and replace in the recovery system ReaR config files
# (usually the content of /etc/rear/ and /var/lib/rear/recovery/ and /var/lib/rear/layout/)
# with updated ReaR config files.
#
# But it is not limited to replace only ReaR config files in the recovery system.
# Anything in the tar.gz archive will be extracted at '/' in the recovery system
# (even if it destroys the recovery system) so that it can also be used to update
# anything in the recovery system - provided one does the update carefully.
# For example one should not replace currently running ReaR scripts.
#
# Currently only a HTTP download location is supported like
#   RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://my_internal_server/$HOSTNAME.rear_config.tgz"
# so that "curl -o recovery-update.tar.gz $RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL" will work.

# The partition type that is used when formatting a medium for use with ReaR via the format workflow.
# It can be 'msdos' to create a MBR partition table or 'gpt' to create a GUID partition table (GPT).
# When UEFI is used the format workflow will create a GUID partition table in any case.
# A MBR partition table limits the maximum usable storage space on the medium to 2TB.
# For larger medium sizes use 'gpt'. If you must use a MBR partition table on a medium > 2TB
# set USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE appropriately so that what is used for ReaR does not exceed
# what works with a MBR partition table but then you cannot use the remaining space on the medium:
USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=msdos

# Filesystem to use for the 'REAR-000' labeled ReaR data partition
# when formatting a medium for use with ReaR via the format workflow.
# Only ext3 and ext4 are supported by the format workflow.
# (An additional EFI system partition uses the vfat filesystem in any case.)
# The default ext3 should work up to a maximum medium size of about 4TB
# while ext4 should work up to a maximum medium size of about 16TB.
# For larger medium sizes set USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE appropriately
# so that what is used for ReaR partitions by the format workflow
# does not exceed what works for the specified USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM:
USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM=ext3

# Percentage of the whole medium that is used for ReaR partitions
# when formatting a medium via the format workflow.
# When UEFI is used it specifies what is used by the format workflow for both partitions,
# the EFI system partition (ESP) plus the 'REAR-000' labeled ReaR data partition.
# A setting of less than 100 (i.e. less than the whole medium)
# does not leave any existing data intact on the medium.
# The format workflow deletes all existing data on the the whole medium.
# A setting of less than 100 only leaves unused space on the medium
# which can be manually used otherwise by the user:
USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=100

# When UEFI is used USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE specifies the size of the EFI system partition (ESP)
# in MB when formatting a medium by the format workflow.
# If USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE is empty or invalid (i.e. not an unsigned integer larger than 0)
# the user must interactively enter a valid value while running the format workflow:
USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="100"

# resulting files that should be copied onto the USB stick
USB_FILES=()

# USB_SUFFIX specifies the last part of the backup directory on the USB medium.
# When USB_SUFFIX is unset or empty, backup on USB works in its default mode which means
# multiple timestamp backup directories of the form rear/HOSTNAME/YYYYMMDD.HHMM
# plus automated rescue environments and backups cleanup via USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR.
# In contrast when USB_SUFFIX is set, backup on USB works in compliance with how backup on NFS works
# (i.e. BACKUP_URL=usb:... and BACKUP_URL=nfs:... behave compatible when USB_SUFFIX is set)
# which means a fixed backup directory of the form rear/HOSTNAME/USB_SUFFIX on the USB medium
# and no automated removal of backups or other files (regardless of USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR)
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1164
# Using multiple backups as described in doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc

# Only with BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP_PROG=tar one can also use incremental or differential backup:
# Incremental or differential backup is currently only known to work with BACKUP_URL=nfs://.
# Other BACKUP_URL schemes may work and at least BACKUP_URL=usb:///... requires USB_SUFFIX to be set
# to work with incremental or differential backup (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145).
# Incremental or differential backup and NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY contradict each other so that
# NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY must not be 'true' in case of incremental or differential backup
# because NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY would move an already existing backup directory away
# but for incremental or differential backup an already existing backup directory must stay there
# so that after the initial full backup the incremental or differential backups can be stored therein.
# With incremental or differential backup there is no need for NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY
# because with incremental or differential backup all backup archives have a date prefix:
# Full backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-F.tar.gz where the 'F' denotes a full backup.
# Incremental backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-I.tar.gz where the 'I' denotes an incremental backup.
# Differential backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-D.tar.gz where the last 'D' denotes a differential backup.
# Therefore all backup archives have different file names so that no old one gets overwritten.
# BACKUP_TYPE=incremental means "rear mkbackup" creates at least one full backup (cf. FULLBACKUPDAY below)
# plus optionally several incremental backups that get created by subsequent "rear mkbackup" runs
# where each new incremental backup is based on the last existing incremental backup
# so that "rear recover" will restore first the latest full backup that exists
# plus all incremental backups in the ordering as they were made after the latest full backup.
# BACKUP_TYPE=differential means "rear mkbackup" creates at least one full backup (cf. FULLBACKUPDAY below)
# plus optionally several differential backups that get created by subsequent "rear mkbackup" runs
# where each new differential backup is based on the last existing full backup
# so that "rear recover" will restore first the latest full backup that exists
# plus one single latest differential backup that was made after the latest full backup.
BACKUP_TYPE=
# Together with BACKUP_TYPE=incremental or BACKUP_TYPE=differential
# you could define on which weekdays "rear mkbackup" will create a full backup.
# If FULLBACKUPDAY is set a full backup will be done on each of the weekdays in the FULLBACKUPDAY array
# in any case (regardless if there already exists a full backup that was created on the same day).
# For example FULLBACKUPDAY=( Sun Wed ) makes a full backup on each Sunday and Wednesday.

# BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY
#
# Move away restored files or directories that should not have been restored:
#
# Do not confuse it with EXCLUDE_RESTORE in the EXCLUDES section below.
# With EXCLUDE_RESTORE items are excluded during backup restore
# where each particular backup method must explicitly implement support
# for the EXCLUDE_RESTORE functionality (most do not support it).
# In contrast BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY works generically
# for any backup restore method.
#
# See https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/779
#
# After backup restore ReaR should move away files or directories
# that should not have been restored - maily files or directories
# that are created and maintained by system tools where
# a restore from the backup results wrong/outdated
# content that conflicts with the actual system.
#
# The generic traditional example of such a file was /etc/mtab.
# As long as it was a regular file it must not have been restored
# with outdated content from a backup. Nowadays it is a symbolic link
# to /proc/self/mounts which should probably be restored to ensure
# that link is available.
#
# ReaR will not remove any file (any user data is sacrosanct).
# Instead ReaR moves those files away into a ReaR-specific directory
# so that the admin can inspect that directory to see what ReaR thinks
# should not have been restored:
readonly BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY="$VAR_DIR/moved_away_after_backup_restore/"
#
# There is nothing hardcoded in the scripts.
# Instead BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES is a documented list
# that explains why each file or directory is moved away.
# The BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is not readonly
# so that it can be modified as needed by the scripts.
# The items in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list do not need to be only files.
# Also a whole directory tree can be moved away (automatically recursively).
# If an item in BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES is a directory only its content
# is (recursively) removed but the original (empty) directory is kept because
# the empty directory alone should not cause issues and usually only the content
# is what results wrong/outdated content that conflicts with the actual system
# or what is no longer needed after system recovery (e.g. content in /var/tmp
# is probably no longer needed but the /var/tmp directory is still needed).
# Already existing stuff in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY that would be (partially)
# overwritten by the items in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is removed before
# (because such stuff is considered as outdated leftover e.g. from a previous recovery)
# but already existing stuff in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY that is not
# in the curent BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is kept.
# Example:
# Probably stuff in the /var/tmp directory is not needed after a system recovery

# How to exclude something ----- EXCLUDES -------
#
# You cannot exclude a device (e.g. /dev/sdg) directly. Instead you have to exclude everything
# ON that device and then the dependancy tracker will automatically exclude the device from the
# recovery (because there won't be any recovery information for that "unnecessary" device).
#
# Furthermore, you have to exclude MD devices and LVM2 volume groups separately as there is no
# automatic detection of these dependancies (yet, please write and submit it !)

# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. Will be automatically added to the
# $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array during backup to prevent the excluded filesystems' data to
# be backed up
# examples: /tmp
#           /media/bigdisk
EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()

# Exclude MD devices
# examples: /dev/md0
#           /dev/md/0
EXCLUDE_MD=()

# Exclude LVM2 volume groups. This will automatically exclude also the creation of the corresponding
# physical and logical volumes that belong to the excluded volume group.
#
# NOTE: YOU MUST ALSO EXCLUDE THE CORRESPONDING MOUNTPOINTS IN EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS (see above)
#       OTHERWISE THE RECOVERY ***WILL*** TRY TO RECREATE THE FILESYSTEMS ONTO NON-EXISTING LVs
#
#       Y O U   H A V E   B E E N   W A R N E D  ! ! !
EXCLUDE_VG=()

# Exclude any component from the recovery image.
# Some component types need a prefix:
# - filesystems: "fs:/var/cache"
# - physical volumes: "pv:/dev/sda2"
# - swap: "swap:/dev/mapper/system-swap"
# Volume groups look like: "/dev/system".
# If in doubt about the correct syntax, consult /var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf
EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=()

####
# Only include LVM2 volume groups - the opposite of EXCLUDE_VG (handy if you only want vg00 to be included)
# EXCLUDE_VG and EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS will get populated automatically, if needed
# syntax : e.g. ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" "vg01" )

# The commands in NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS get copied at the beginning
# of /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh that is the main script
# which runs while booting the rescue/recovery system to set up network devices.
# The primary intent is to be able to specify special commands for special cases
# as preparation so that the subsequent autogenerated network devices setup code
# in the 60-network-devices.sh script can successfully set up network devices
# (for details see usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh).
# But NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS is not limited to its primary intent.
# For example it can also be used to set up networking completely manually in the rescue/recovery system via something like
# NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 192.168.100.2/24 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 192.168.100.1' 'return' )
# where the last command lets the 60-network-devices.sh script directly return
# so that the subsequent autogenerated network devices setup code will not be run.
# The by default empty NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS means the 60-network-devices.sh script
# is autogenerated according to the network devices setup in the currently running system
# i.e. the default is an automated network devices setup in the rescue/recovery system
# that should match the network devices setup in the currently running system:

# GRUB_RESCUE [ GRUB_RESCUE_USER ]
#
# Add a ReaR rescue/recovery system to the GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader of the currently running system.
# It adds kernel and the ReaR initrd to the bootloader directory in the currently running system and
# adds a 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB/GRUB2 menue entry to boot that locally installed ReaR rescue system.
# Note that GRUB_RESCUE is the only functionality where "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue"
# changes the currently running system. It changes the currently running system even
# in a critical way because it changes the bootloader of the currently running system.
# The main reason for the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is to be quickly able to recover a system
# from soft errors (like deleting all of /lib/) without digging out the ReaR recovery boot medium.
# When booting that locally installed ReaR recovery system it does the same as when booting
# the ReaR recovery system from an external ReaR boot medium - i.e. "rear recover" replaces the
# whole current system with a recreated system where all files are restored from the backup.
# To be on the safe side the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is disabled by default:
GRUB_RESCUE=n
# Optional password protection via GRUB_RESCUE_USER only works for GRUB2 with Legacy BIOS booting.
# GRUB_RESCUE_USER is not supported for UEFI booting (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/954).
# GRUB2 password protection requires an existing GRUB2 user with a password.
# If the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is enabled (e.g. via GRUB_RESCUE=y in /etc/rear/local.conf)
# a non-empty GRUB_RESCUE_USER can be optionally set to get GRUB2 password protection
# for the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry.
# When GRUB_RESCUE_USER is non-empty it must specify an already configured GRUB2 user
# except the special value 'unrestricted' is set via GRUB_RESCUE_USER="unrestricted"
# which creates the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry so that it can be booted by anyone
# which means anyone who can boot the currently running system can replace it via "rear recover".
# When GRUB_RESCUE_USER is empty ReaR does not do a GRUB2 user related setup
# so that the already existing GRUB2 users configuration determines
# which users can boot the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry.
# Usually this means anyone can boot 'Relax-and-Recover' which means anyone
# who can boot the currently running system can replace it via "rear recover".
GRUB_RESCUE_USER=""
# The former GRUB2 superuser setup support in ReaR via GRUB_SUPERUSER is dropped and
# also the former GRUB2 password setup support in ReaR via GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD is dropped.
# Both kind of setup can change the behaviour of the GRUB2 bootloader as a whole in unexpected ways
# but ReaR is not meant to change the general GRUB2 configuration of the currently running system.
# It works by default reasonably backward compatible when formerly a GRUB_SUPERUSER was used
# which means a GRUB2 superuser was set up by ReaR in /etc/grub.d/01_users with GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD
# so that the empty GRUB_RESCUE_USER results that the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry
# can only be booted by the formerly set GRUB_SUPERUSER with the formerly set GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD.

# USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER
#
# UEFI (Secure booting) support is partly available in ReaR (at least for Fedora, RHEL)
# SLES, openSUSE do not work out of the box due to issues with making an UEFI bootable ISO image.
# SLES, openSUSE need the additional tool 'ebiso' to make an UEFI bootable ISO image
# (via ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso - see the ISO_MKISOFS_BIN variable above).
# The next variable can explitly specify whether or not an UEFI bootloader should be used:
# USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=   means let ReaR try to find it out by itself (default)
# USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=0  means we do not want UEFI capable ISO and no efi tools in ReaR image
# USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1  means we want UEFI ISO image and all efi tools to recreate the secure boot
# instead of '0' also any value that is recognized as 'no' by the is_false function can be used
# instead of '1' also any value that is recognized as 'yes' by the is_true function can be used
