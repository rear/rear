#
# Here we define and describe all configuration variables and set them to a default.
#
# Do not change them here. Set them in your site.conf or local.conf file as needed.
#
# Many variables are bash arrays that should be set carefully.
# Use VAR=() to set an empty array.
# Use VAR+=( 'value' ) to append a fixed value to an array.
# Use VAR+=( "$var" ) to append a variable value to an array.
# Whether or not the latter case works as intended depends on when and
# how "$var" is set and evaluated by the Relax-and-Recover scripts.
# Be careful with values that are globbing patterns (cf. COPY_AS_IS below).
# Globbing patterns should not be quoted like VAR+=( /directory/* )
# when for globbing patterns bash pathname expansion is intended
# in contrast to quoted globbing patterns like VAR+=( '/directory/*' )
# where bash pathname expansion would usually not happen.
# In general using ${VAR[*]} is problematic and
# using ${VAR[@]} without double-quotes is also problematic
# so to prepend to an array use VAR=( 'prepend_value' "${VAR[@]}" )
# see 'Arrays' in "man bash" and for some examples see
# https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068
#
# Most variables can be set to an empty value VAR= which means that this
# setting is off or set to some automatic mode.
#
# Boolean variables can be set to anything as we only check whether the variable
# is not empty so that both VAR=yes and VAR=no evaluate to boolean 'true'.
# To set a boolean variable to 'false' set it to an empty value.
#
# Some variables have ternary semantics:
# - explicit true value like True T true t Yes Y yes y 1
# - explicit false value like False F false f No N no n 0
# - unset or empty or a value that is neither a true value nor a false value
# (see the is_true and is_false functions in lib/global-functions.sh).
#
# In case of doubt inspect the scripts how exactly a particular variable works.

##
# TMPDIR
#
# Relax-and-Recover needs a (temporary) working area where it builds in particular
# the rescue/recovery system ISO image (and perhaps even stores the backup archive).
# The directory name of the working area is created in /usr/sbin/rear by calling
#   mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# which usually results /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX or $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# the latter when the canonical Linux/Unix environment variable TMPDIR
# is set in the environment where /usr/sbin/rear is called.
# To have a specific working area directory prefix for Relax-and-Recover call
#   export TMPDIR="/prefix/for/rear/working/directory"
# before calling 'rear' (/prefix/for/rear/working/directory must already exist).
# This is useful for example when there is not sufficient free space
# in /var/tmp or $TMPDIR for the ISO image or even the backup archive.
# TMPDIR cannot be set to a default value here unconditionally but only
# if it is not set before calling the program, otherwise /usr/sbin/rear
# would not work in compliance with the Linux/Unix standards regarding TMPDIR
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968
# The default is /var/tmp instead of the more usual /tmp (the system default),
# because /tmp is not intended for such large amounts of data that ReaR usually
# produces when creating the image (see file-hierarchy(7)). In particular,
# /tmp can be a tmpfs, and thus restricted by the available RAM/swap.
export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}"

##
# ROOT_HOME_DIR
#
# According to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
# the home directory for the root user has to be '/root'
# cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
# but you may set it as needed like ROOT_HOME_DIR=~root
# ~root is not included into double (or single) quotes so it can be
# later expanded to actual root home directory.
ROOT_HOME_DIR=~root

# You can override autodetection and specify the kernel for the rescue/recovery system:
KERNEL_FILE=""
# The kernel configuration is used to collect the kernel binary and modules.
# It can be set to a different version (e.g. to create a UP rescue media on a SMP system):
KERNEL_VERSION="${KERNEL_VERSION:-$( uname -r )}"
# You can add arbitrary kernel command line parameters when booting the rescue/recovery system
# as you need it (e.g. things like 'console=...' see USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE below).
# Additionally Relax-and-Recover supports some special kernel command line parameters like
# - 'debug'
#   Starts all init-scripts (in /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/ in the rescue/recovery system)
#   in debug mode (via 'set -x') and asks for confirmation before it runs each init-script.
# - 'auto_recover' or 'automatic'
#   Launch rear recover automatically (without automated reboot).
#   Together with debug it runs rear recover in debug mode.
# - 'unattended'
#   Launch rear recover automatically as with auto_recover
#   plus automated reboot after successful rear recover.
# - 'ip=...' 'nm=...' 'netdev=...' 'gw=...'
#   If IP address plus optionally netmask (default 255.255.255.0),
#   network device (default eth0), and a default gateway are specified
#   only that single network device is set up.
#   Example: ip=192.168.100.2 nm=255.255.255.0 netdev=eth0 gw=192.168.100.1
# - 'noip'
#   Prevents initialization of the networking configuration which is useful when
#   you want to do the networking configuration manually in the rescue/recovery system
#   e.g. to prevent the rescue/recovery system to use same IP address as the original system
#   but for the latter using USE_DHCLIENT="yes" (see below) is probably easier.
# See also the 'RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS' section in the ReaR man page ("man rear"):
KERNEL_CMDLINE=""
# The COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS array lists kernel parameter that should be part of the KERNEL_CMDLINE (in rescue image)
# if present on the current system (/proc/cmdline).
# COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS should only store kernel parameter key, not the value (ex: net.ifnames but not net.ifnames=0)
# If the key-value kernel parameter is already set in KERNEL_CMDLINE variable it will always superseed
# the one detected on the current system (if any).
# - Check net.ifnames and biosdevname kernel parameter as it may impact the network interface name during recovery/migration.

# - 'errors' to obtain the old behaviour where KEEP_BUILD_DIR was always set to true
#   to keep the build area when errors in the ReaR recovery system were detected.
# - empty (KEEP_BUILD_DIR="") which means that the build area will be kept on errors
#   if running interactively (in a terminal) but not otherwise to avoid cluttering
#   TMPDIR (see above) by cron or other automated jobs in case of errors.

# No default workflows. This variable is filled in where the workflows are defined

# Allow some workflows to not lock and use a separate logfile named 'LOGFILE.lockless'.
# The LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS array gets filled during runtime as needed by the various
# usr/share/rear/lib/WORKFLOW-workflow.sh scripts. Currently the following workflows
# add themselves to the LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS array: checklayout dump help
# To make setting the right logfile name working in usr/sbin/rear
# the lockless workflows must also be predefined here (cf. usr/sbin/rear):
LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS=( 'checklayout' 'dump' 'help' )
# SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS are also allowed to run simultaneously
# but cannot use LOGFILE.lockless as the LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS.
# Instead the SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS get a LOGFILE with PID
# because simultaneously runnable workflows require unique logfile names
# so that the PID is interposed in the LOGFILE value from default.conf above,
# i.e. by default SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS use during runtime
# a logfile named /var/log/rear/rear-$HOSTNAME.$$.log that gets
# at the end copied to a final possibly used-defined LOGFILE,

# Other output (e.g. from programs that are called) is not prefixed.
# By default MESSAGE_PREFIX is empty but the user can set it e.g. to MESSAGE_PREFIX="$$: "
# to get ReaR messages prefixed with the PID of the running 'rear' main program which is
# basically a requirement when workflows are run simultaneously to get distinguishable
# messages (cf. SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS)
MESSAGE_PREFIX=""

##
# PROGRESS_MODE
#
# How progress messages are shown (cf. lib/progresssubsystem.nosh).
# PROGRESS_MODE can be "ANSI" (default/fallback) or "plain".
# When there is a tty on stdout messages via the progress subsystem
# are by default shown with ANSI escape sequences so that all
# subsequent progress messages appear on one same line.
# With PROGRESS_MODE="plain" the progress subsystem outputs the same
# messages as in "ANSI" mode but without ANSI escape sequences.
# PROGRESS_MODE="plain" is basically a requirement when workflows
# are run simultaneously (cf. SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS) because
# otherwise the progress messages from simultaneously running workflows
# would mix up on one same line which results illegible and meaningless
# output on the terminal
PROGRESS_MODE="ANSI"

##
# PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS
#
# The number of seconds between subsequent progress messages that are output
# via the progress subsystem while a longer task (usually backup or restore) runs.
# The default/fallback is 1 second. Setting e.g. PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS="5" can be
# used to get less progress messages on the terminal but at the same time it delays
# continuing after the task (e.g. backup or restore) had finished by half that time
# on average up to at most the whole amount of PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS

#
# USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT
# USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT
# USER_INPUT_PROMPT
# USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS
# USER_INPUT_user_input_ID
#
# USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT specifies the default timeout in seconds
# after that UserInput() automatically proceeds with a default value.
# That timeout interrupts a possibly ongoing user input
# (same as the timeout of the 'read' bash builtin).
# The UserInput timeout must be sufficiently long for the user
# to read and understand the possibly unexpected UserInput() message
# and then some more time to make a decision whether or not
# the default action ("just proceed") is actually the right one
# in his particular case and finally even more time to enter
# his particular input when the default is not the right one.
# USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also like
#   export USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=30
# directly before he calls "rear ...":
test "$USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT" || USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=300
#
# USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT specifies the default timeout in seconds
# for how long UserInput() waits for the user to interrupt an automated input
# when a predefined input value is specified for a particular UserInput() call
# via a matching USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variable (see below).
# The minimum waiting time to interrupt an automated input is one second.
# The default is 10 seconds to give the user a better chance to recognize
# an automated input and be able to actually hit a key to interrupt.
# USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also like
#   export USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT=5
# directly before he calls "rear ...":
test "$USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT" || USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT=10
#
# USER_INPUT_PROMPT specifies the default prompt text that is shown
# if no prompt was specified for a particular UserInput() call.
# USER_INPUT_PROMPT is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also like
#   export USER_INPUT_PROMPT="$HOSTNAME input"
# directly before he calls "rear ...":
test "$USER_INPUT_PROMPT" || USER_INPUT_PROMPT='enter your input'
#
# USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS specifies the default maximum characters until
# the UserInput function truncates further input and returns.
# With the default USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS=0 input is not truncated and it
# also makes correcting the input possible (before [Enter] is pressed)
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2622
# USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also like
#   export USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS=200
# directly before he calls "rear ...":
test "$USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS" || USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS=0
#
# USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variables can be used to predefine automated
# input for UserInput() calls with the matching user_input_ID value.
# Each UserInput() call has a specific user_input_ID that is shown
# when ReaR is run in debug mode (via the '-d' command line option).
# For example "rear -d recover" may show something like:
#   UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed ...
#   Confirm or edit the disk mapping
#   1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
#   2) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
#   3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
#   4) Abort 'rear recover'
#   (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
# In this case one can specify a predefined input in local.conf like
#   USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS=2
# or directly on command line before running "rear recover" like
#   export USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS=2
# The user_input_ID that is shown 'LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS'
# must be appended to a USER_INPUT_ variable prefix to get the right
# USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS variable name.
# Then the "Edit disk mapping" choice will be selected automatically.
# In this case the USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT is crucial because
# otherwise one would be caught in an endless "Edit disk mapping" loop.

# Default backup and output targets:
BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE
OUTPUT=ISO

# Default cdrom size in MB (probably it is actually MiB?):

# The CHECK_CONFIG_FILES array lists files where changes
# require the ReaR rescue/recovery system to be recreated.
# Testing whether or not those files changed is implemented in the checklayout workflow
# which exits with non-zero exit code when the disk layout or those files changed

# Relax-and-Recover recovery system update during "rear recover"
#
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841
# and https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects/1508
#
# The by default empty RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL means this functionality is not used so that
# "rear recover" runs as usual without updating any files in the ReaR recovery system
# (i.e. with the recovery system as "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue" had made it).
#
# If RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL is non-empty it points to a download location
# wherefrom "rear recover" will first of all download a tar.gz archive and
# extract that at the root directory '/' in the ReaR recovery system.
#
# The intended purpose is to download and replace in the recovery system ReaR config files
# (usually the content of /etc/rear/ and /var/lib/rear/recovery/ and /var/lib/rear/layout/)
# with updated ReaR config files.
#
# But it is not limited to replace only ReaR config files in the recovery system.
# Anything in the tar.gz archive will be extracted at '/' in the recovery system
# (even if it destroys the recovery system) so that it can also be used to update
# anything in the recovery system - provided one does the update carefully.
# For example one should not replace currently running ReaR scripts.
#
# Currently only a HTTP download location is supported like
#   RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://my_internal_server/$HOSTNAME.rear_config.tgz"
# so that "curl -o recovery-update.tar.gz $RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL" will work.
# Accordingly when using RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://..."
# curl should be added to the REQUIRED_PROGS array like
#   REQUIRED_PROGS+=( curl )
#
# RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also via
#   export RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://my_internal_server/host123_rear_config.tgz"
# directly before he calls "rear recover":

##
# MIGRATION_MODE recovery during "rear recover"
#
# There is some basic autodetection during "rear recover" when
# disks on the replacement hardware seem to not match compared to
# what there was stored in disklayout.conf on the original system.
# If a mismatch is autodetected then ReaR goes into its
# MIGRATION_MODE where manual disk layout configuration happens.
# In this case ReaR asks the user via several user dialogs what to do.
# Only the disk size is used to determine whether or not
# disks on the replacement hardware match the disks on the original system.
# Problems only appear when more than one disk with same size is used.
# Examples:
# When on the original system and on the replacement hardware two disks
# with same size are used the disk devices may get interchanged
# so that what there was on /dev/sda on the original system may get
# recreated on /dev/sdb on the replacement hardware and vice versa.
# When on the original system one disk is used for the system and
# another disk with same size for the ReaR recovery system and backup
# the disk devices may get interchanged on the replacement hardware
# so that "rear recover" could result an ultimate disaster
# (instead of a recovery from a disaster) if it recreated the system
# on the disk where the ReaR recovery system and backup is
# which would overwrite/destroy the backup via parted and mkfs
# (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271).
# Therefore to be on the safe side and to avoid such problems
# ReaR goes by default automatically into its MIGRATION_MODE
# when more than one disk with same size is used on the original system
# or when for one of the used disk sizes on the original system
# more than one disk with same size is found on the replacement hardware
# i.e. when there is more than one possible target disk.
# Accordingly ReaR goes by default not into its MIGRATION_MODE
# only if for each used disk size on the original system eaxctly one
# possible target disk with same size is found on the replacement hardware.
# By setting MIGRATION_MODE='true' one can enfore MIGRATION_MODE.
# The by-default empty MIGRATION_MODE results that MIGRATION_MODE
# is set via the above described autodetection during "rear recover".
# MIGRATION_MODE is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also via
#   export MIGRATION_MODE='true'
# directly before he calls "rear recover":
test "$MIGRATION_MODE" || MIGRATION_MODE=''

##
# Wiping disks during "rear recover" before recreating the disk layout:
#
# The intent is that disks where the disk layout will be recreated
# get completely wiped as far as possible with reasonable effort,
# see usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/README.wipe_disks
# so that the disk layout recreation code (diskrestore.sh)
# can run on clean disks that behave like pristine new disks,
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799
# This is currently new and experimental functionality,
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2514
#
# An empty DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED='' means that disks will be automatically wiped.
# The disks that will be automatically wiped are those disks
# where in diskrestore.sh the create_disk_label function is called
# i.e. disks where the whole partitioning will be recreated from scratch.
# This automatism cannot work when the create_disk_label function is called
# for higher level block devices like RAID devices that do not exist as disks
# on the bare replacement hardware or on a bare replacement virtual machine.
# When disk devices are specified like DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED="/dev/sda /dev/sdb"
# all those that actually exist as block devices in the recovery system
# (i.e. on the replacement hardware or on the replacement virtual machine)
# will be wiped without any safety condition (except WRITE_PROTECTED_IDS)
# and regardless if those disks are actually needed to recreate the system.
# So e.g. DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED="/dev/sd[a-z]" will wipe all /dev/sda ... /dev/sdz that exist
# except when for a disk in the recovery system its ID is listed in WRITE_PROTECTED_IDS
# (listing disk IDs of the original system in WRITE_PROTECTED_IDS does not help).
# When the ReaR recovery system was booted from a (USB) disk that is /dev/sda on the
# replacement hardware then DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED="/dev/sda ..." may destroy the ReaR disk
# unless that disk is (by default automatically) listed in WRITE_PROTECTED_IDS
# (here it works because the ReaR disk ID is same on the replacement hardware).
# In any case there is a user confirmation dialog for the disks that will be wiped.
# Currently by default no disk is wiped to avoid issues until this feature was more tested:
DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED='false'

# Resizing partitions in MIGRATION_MODE during "rear recover"
#
# AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS
# AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS
# AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE
# AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE
#
# For details see the scripts
# usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh
# and
# usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/430_autoresize_all_partitions.sh
#
# When AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is false, no partition is resized.
#
# When AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is true, all active partitions on all active disks
# get resized by the 430_autoresize_all_partitions.sh script
# (except boot and swap partitions via some special hardcoded rules in that script)
# if the disk size had changed (i.e. only in migration mode).
# This does not resize volumes on top of the affected partitions.
# Using AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS='true' with 430_autoresize_all_partitions.sh
# may result badly aligned partitions in particular possibly harmful aligned
# according to what flash memory based disks (i.e. SSDs) actually need
# which is usually 4MiB or 8MiB alignment where a too small value
# will result lower speed and less lifetime of flash memory devices
# (cf. the below comment at USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE).
#
# A true or false value must be the first one in the AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS array.
#
# When the first value in AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is neither true nor false
# only the last active partition on each active disk gets resized
# by the 420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh script.
#
# The following applies only when the last active partition on each active disk
# gets resized by the 420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh script:
#
# In particular this does not resize volumes on top of the affected partitions.
# To migrate volumes on a disk where the disk size had changed the user must in advance
# manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".
#
# All other values in the AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS array specify partition device nodes
# e.g. as in AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS=( /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb3 )
# where last partitions with those partition device nodes should be resized
# (i.e. this way only last partitions can be specified to be resized)
# regardless of what is specified in the AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS array.
#
# The values in the AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS array specify partition device nodes
# where partitions with those partition device nodes are excluded from being resized.
# The special values 'boot', 'swap', and 'efi' specify that
#  - partitions where its filesystem mountpoint contains 'boot' or 'bios' or 'grub'
#    or where its GPT name or flags contain 'boot' or 'bios' or 'grub' (anywhere case insensitive)
#  - partitions for which an active 'swap' entry exists in disklayout.conf
#    or where its GPT name or flags contain 'swap' (anywhere case insensitive)
#  - partitions where its filesystem mountpoint contains 'efi' or 'esp'
#    or where its GPT name or flags contains 'efi' or 'esp' (anywhere case insensitive)
# are excluded from being resized e.g. as in
# AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS=( boot swap efi /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdc4 )
#
# In general ReaR is not meant to somehow "optimize" a system during "rear recover".
# ReaR is meant to recreate a system as much as possible exactly as it was before.
# Accordingly the automated resizing by the 420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh script
# implements a "minimal changes" approach:
#
# When the new disk is a bit smaller (at most AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE percent),
# only the last (active) partition gets shrinked but all other partitions are not changed.
# When the new disk is smaller than AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE percent it errors out.
# To migrate onto a substantially smaller new disk the user must in advance
# manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".
#
# When the new disk is not much bigger (less than AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE percent),
# no partition gets increased (which leaves the bigger disk space at the end of the disk unused).
# When the new disk is substantially bigger (at least AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE percent),
# only the last (active) partition gets increased but all other partitions are not changed.
# To migrate various partitions onto a substantially bigger new disk the user must in advance
# manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".
#
# Because only the end value of the last partition may get changed, the partitioning alignment

# Creating XFS filesystems during "rear recover"

# MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS
# MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_...
#
# For details see the script
# usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130_include_filesystem_code.sh
# and for some reasoning behind you may have a look at
# https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005
#
# During "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" the script layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh
# calls 'xfs_info' and stores its output in var/lib/rear/layout/xfs/XFS_DEVICE.xfs files
# where XFS_DEVICE is the basename of the device where the XFS filesystem is (e.g. sda2).
# By default during "rear recover" the XFS filesystem on that device gets recreated
# with matching mkfs.xfs options according to the stored 'xfs_info' output so that
# XFS filesystems should get recreated with same XFS filesystem options as before.
#
# In particular in MIGRATION_MODE when disk devices had changed it could be needed
# to recreate XFS filesystems with different XFS filesystem options as before.
# MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS specifies global mkfs.xfs options for recreating all XFS filesystems.
# Device specific mkfs.xfs options can be specified for each XFS device via
# MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_XFS_DEVICE where XFS_DEVICE is the basename of the device
# but only uppercase letters and digits to ensure a valid bash variable name.
# For example for /dev/sda2 it would be MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_SDA2 and
# for /dev/mapper/ACME_1000-part3 it would be MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_ACME1000PART3
# Common global options can be specified first like MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS="global options"
# and used via MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_SDA2="$MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS additional options for sda2"
# versus separated options as in MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_SDB3="all options for sdb3".
# To recreate XFS filesystems with the mkfs.xfs defaults (i.e. without mkfs.xfs options)
# specify a space MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS=' ' or MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_SDA2=' ' only for sda2.
#
# The by-default empty MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS results that the mkfs.xfs options are set
# via the above described default according to the stored 'xfs_info' output.
# MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also via
#   export MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS="..."

# Default "local" ISO directory (usually /var/lib/rear/output). However, to avoid duplicate ISO images when
# also using the OUTPUT_URL variable with a file syntax, it is then better only to use ISO_DIR.
# Keep in mind that ISO_DIR works only with an absolute directory path and does not replace OUTPUT_URL
# which supports the NETFS syntax (to copy the ISO image across the network).
ISO_DIR=$VAR_DIR/output
#
# Default ISO label:
# When the backup is split on multiple ISOs (cf. ISO_MAX_SIZE below)
# the first ISO 'rear-HOSTNAME.iso' has the label $ISO_VOLID
# and subsequent ISOs 'rear-HOSTNAME_01.iso' 'rear-HOSTNAME_02.iso' ...
# get the labels ${ISO_VOLID}_01 ${ISO_VOLID}_02 ... respectively.
# The ISO_VOLID default value REAR-ISO has 8 characters so that
# the first ISO 'rear-HOSTNAME.iso' has the label REAR-ISO
# and subsequent ISOs 'rear-HOSTNAME_01.iso' 'rear-HOSTNAME_02.iso' ...
# get the labels REAR-ISO_01 REAR-ISO_02 ... respectively
# that have 11 characters which is the maximum length for FAT volume names
# ("man mkfs.fat" tells that a "volume name can be up to 11 characters long")
# so things work when the ISO image is used to create a FAT bootable USB stick
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565
# and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2456
# In case of special filesystems that only support labels with even less than 11 characters
# ("man mkfs.xfs" tells "XFS filesystem labels can be at most 12 characters long" so it's ok)
# the ISO_VOLID value would have to be appropriately specified in /etc/rear/local.conf

# How to find isolinux.bin.
# Possible values are "" (meaning search for it) or "/path/to/isolinux.bin"
ISO_ISOLINUX_BIN=""
#
# ISO_MAX_SIZE is a rough way to specify the maximum size of generated ISO images.
# The ISO_MAX_SIZE value is specified in MiB.
# Actually ISO_MAX_SIZE does not implement the maximum size of the ISO.
# Instead it is used to calculate the size of the chunks when a backup.tar.gz is split
# that is used in a "split ... -b ${BACKUP_SPLIT_CHUNK_SIZE}m ..." SPLIT_COMMAND
# in the usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh script.
# Splitting a backup via ISO_MAX_SIZE is only supported for the 'tar' backup program.
# Multiple ISO images are generated when the backup.tar.gz size exceeds
# the BACKUP_SPLIT_CHUNK_SIZE that is derived from the ISO_MAX_SIZE value.
# It is useful when the backup.tar.gz is included within the ISO image
# (i.e. together with things like 'BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup').
# ISO_MAX_SIZE cannot be less than what the ReaR rescue/recovery system needs
# because the recovery system must fit onto one (bootable) recovery medium
# so that the whole recovery system must be on a single (bootable) ISO.
# Therefore ISO_MAX_SIZE should be normally not less than about 600 MiB.
# Because the ReaR recovery system and its bootloader must be on the first ISO
# the actually used size of the chunks when a backup.tar.gz is split is the
# ISO_MAX_SIZE value minus the size of the recovery system kernel and initrd
# and minus 15 MiB for the bootloader for booting the ISO and
# additionally minus 30 MiB for UEFI files when booting in UEFI mode
# so that the recovery system plus the first chunk of the backup.tar.gz
# should not exceed the specified ISO_MAX_SIZE value for the first ISO.
# On the other hand the actual size of subsequent ISO images
# is normally less than the specified ISO_MAX_SIZE value.
# When the backup is split on multiple ISOs, then "rear mkrescue" would destroy
# the backup because after "rear mkbackup" the first ISO 'rear-HOSTNAME.iso'
# contains the recovery system plus the first part of the splitted backup
# but "rear mkrescue" overwrites that first ISO with one that contains only
# a new recovery system but no longer the first part of the splitted backup
# so that then "rear recover" fails with "ERROR: Backup archive ... not found"
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545
# Even with a sufficiently big maximum ISO size so that all is in one ISO
# "rear mkrescue" would overwrite an ISO that already contains a backup.
# Accordingly when ISO_MAX_SIZE is set the mkrescue workflow is forbidden
# to be on the safe side to not possibly destroy an existing backup.
ISO_MAX_SIZE=
#
# Error out when files greater or equal ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT should be included in the ISO.
# There is a limit of the ISO 9660 file system that is 2GiB or 4GiB according to
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660#The_2/4_GiB_file_size_limit
# Usually 'mkisofs' is called with '-iso-level 3'
# cf. usr/share/rear/prep/ISO/GNU/Linux/320_verify_mkisofs.sh
# but there are cases where ISO 9660 level 1 or 2 is used that has a 2GiB file size limit.
# For example when 'ebiso' is used there is a 2GiB file size limit
# cf. https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues/12
# but also other tools that are specified by ISO_MKISOFS_BIN could have that limit.
# Accordingly to be by default on the safe side we use by default a 2GiB limit
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2525
# Under normal circumstances files greater or equal 2GiB should not appear in the ISO.
# An exception is when the backup is included in the ISO with BACKUP_URL=iso://
# where the backup archive file (e.g. backup.tar.gz) could be greater or equal 2GiB.
# The user might adapt ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT provided he verified that "rear recover"
# actually works in his particular environment even when there are files in his ISO
# (in particular backup.tar.gz) that are actually greater than the default 2GiB limit.
# When there is a 2GiB file size limit a backup.tar.gz that is greater than 2GiB
# will get corrupted in the ISO so backup restore via "rear recover" would fail
# which is a dead end because the backup in the ISO got corrupted which is a severe error.
# Also the ReaR recovery system initrd could become greater or equal 2GiB
# (e.g. because of accidentally too much in COPY_AS_IS) which is likely an error
# that could let booting or running the recovery system fail because
# a recovery system in a 2GiB or bigger compressed initrd will need
# more memory space when uncompressed and running in the ramdisk.
# By default we error out when files greater or equal ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT should be
# included in the ISO but if really needed this ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT test
# can be skipped with ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=0 in etc/rear/local.conf

# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2293#issuecomment-564439509
# If ISO_DEFAULT is unset or empty or only blanks "boothd" is used by default.
# ISO_DEFAULT="boothd" is an automatism that intends to boot from the original first disk.
# In case of ISOLINUX "boothd" means to boot from the first disk 'boothd0' because
# usually ISOLINUX is used for booting from CD-ROM which is usually not the first disk
# so that the original first disk still is the first disk when booting the ISO from CD-ROM.
# In case of EXTLINUX "boothd" would mean to boot from the second disk 'boothd1' because
# usually when EXTLINUX is used the device with the ISO would be the first disk
# and the original first disk would become the second disk (cf. USB_BIOS_BOOT_DEFAULT below).
# ISO_DEFAULT="boothd0" boots from the first disk.
# ISO_DEFAULT="boothd1" boots from the second disk.
# The ISO_DEFAULT values 'boothd' 'boothd0' 'boothd1' are only supported
# when the SYSLINUX module 'chain.c32' for chain booting is available.
# ISO_DEFAULT="manual" boots the ReaR recovery system in normal mode
# where one must manually log in as 'root', manually type "rear recover", and manually reboot.
# ISO_DEFAULT="automatic" boots the ReaR recovery system with the 'auto_recover' kernel command line option
# that runs "rear recover" automatically without automated reboot (see "man rear").
# For details see the make_syslinux_config function in lib/bootloader-functions.sh
ISO_DEFAULT="boothd"
#
# ISO_RECOVER_MODE="unattended" boots the ReaR recovery system with the 'unattended' kernel command line option

# Together with ISO_DEFAULT="automatic" full-automated recovery happens when the ISO image is booted
# which could result an endless full-automated recovery cycle when the ISO is booted by default
# (e.g. when the device with the ISO is the first one in the BIOS boot order list).
# The default ISO_RECOVER_MODE="" results the normal behaviour:

# OUTPUT=USB stuff
##
#
# OUTPUT=USB is only supported on PC-compatible (Linux-i386/x86/x86_64) architecture
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2348
# Accordingly in case of false usage of OUTPUT=USB on non-PC-compatible architectures
# (i.e. the POWER architectures ppc64/ppc64le, IBM Z s390/s390x, and ARM)
# "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" errors out because on those architectures the USB medium cannot be booted
# because for non-PC-compatible architectures there are no scripts that install a USB bootloader.
# On non-PC-compatible architectures a possible alternative could be OUTPUT=RAMDISK (see above)
# that results only the plain ReaR rescue/recovery system initramfs/initrd plus the kernel
# (which is basically what OUTPUT=USB on non-PC-compatible architectures would result)
# where one must then manually create a bootable medium for non-PC-compatible architectures
# or load and boot the recovery system initrd plus kernel via 'kexec' from an already running system.
# A workaround to get a bootable USB device on POWER architecture for Power BareMetal is described
# in the usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-ppc64/350_safeguard_error_out.sh script.
#
# OUTPUT=USB produces files suitable for booting with SYSLINUX/EXTLINUX from a disk device.
# USB sticks and USB disks are the main use case for this.
# "USB" also means any local block-storage device and includes eSATA and other external disks.
# The device is also made bootable and a boot loader gets installed.
# The device should be partitioned and formatted with an ext* file system.
# The recommended way to do that is to use the "rear format" workflow.
# Call "rear format -- --help" (the '--' is mandatory) to see format workflow options.

# When UEFI is used the format workflow will create a GUID partition table in any case.
# A MBR partition table limits the maximum usable storage space on the medium to 2TB.
# For larger medium sizes use 'gpt'. If you must use a MBR partition table on a medium > 2TB
# set USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE appropriately so that what is used for ReaR does not exceed

# For OBDR only the default 'REAR-000' works (a label with exactly 8 characters length may also work)

# (An additional EFI system partition uses the vfat filesystem in any case.)
# The default ext3 should work up to a maximum medium size of about 4TB
# while ext4 should work up to a maximum medium size of about 16TB.
# For larger medium sizes set USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE appropriately
# so that what is used for ReaR partitions by the format workflow
# does not exceed what works for the specified USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM:

#
# USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PARAMS allow to add optimisations to the formatting

# A setting of less than 100 (i.e. less than the whole medium)
# does not leave any existing data intact on the medium.

# USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE specifies partitioning alignment in MiB
# when formatting a medium via the format workflow.
# The default alignment of 8 MiB is intended in particular for flash memory devices.
# The partitioning tool can't figure out optimal alignment values for many flash memory devices.
# The flashbench command helps determining "erase block size" a.k.a. "segment size"
# a.k.a. "allocation unit size" for your particular flash memory device.
# A too small value will result lower speed and less lifetime of your flash memory device.
# A sufficiently big value will improve speed and lifetime of your flash memory device.

# When UEFI is used USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE specifies the size of the EFI system partition (ESP)
# in MiB when formatting a medium by the format workflow.
# If USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE is empty or invalid (i.e. not an unsigned integer larger than 0)
# the user must interactively enter a valid value while running the format workflow.
# The default value of 512 MiB should be sufficiently big and it is in compliance
# with the 8 MiB partition alignment default value ( 512 = 8 * 64 )
# and also with higher 2^n MiB partition alignment values
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1205
# Furthermore the default value of 512 MiB results that the FAT filesystem of the ESP
# will be in compliance with that the ESP should officially use a FAT32 filesystem
# because mkfs.vfat automatically makes a FAT32 filesystem starting at 512 MiB
# (a FAT16 ESP works in most cases but causes issues with certain UEFI firmware)
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2575

BACKUP_INTEGRITY_CHECK=
# Define BACKUP_TYPE.
# By default BACKUP_TYPE is empty which means "rear mkbackup" will create a full backup.
# Only with BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP_PROG=tar one can also use incremental or differential backup:
# Incremental or differential backup is currently only known to work with BACKUP_URL=nfs://.
# Other BACKUP_URL schemes may work and at least BACKUP_URL=usb:///... requires USB_SUFFIX to be set
# to work with incremental or differential backup (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145).
# Incremental or differential backup and NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY contradict each other so that
# NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY must not be 'true' in case of incremental or differential backup
# because NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY would move an already existing backup directory away
# but for incremental or differential backup an already existing backup directory must stay there
# so that after the initial full backup the incremental or differential backups can be stored therein.
# With incremental or differential backup there is no need for NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY
# because with incremental or differential backup all backup archives have a date prefix:
# Full backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-F.tar.gz where the 'F' denotes a full backup.
# Incremental backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-I.tar.gz where the 'I' denotes an incremental backup.
# Differential backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-D.tar.gz where the last 'D' denotes a differential backup.
# Therefore all backup archives have different file names so that no old one gets overwritten.
# BACKUP_TYPE=incremental means "rear mkbackup" creates at least one full backup (cf. FULLBACKUPDAY below)
# plus optionally several incremental backups that get created by subsequent "rear mkbackup" runs
# where each new incremental backup is based on the last existing incremental backup
# so that "rear recover" will restore first the latest full backup that exists
# plus all incremental backups in the ordering as they were made after the latest full backup.
# BACKUP_TYPE=differential means "rear mkbackup" creates at least one full backup (cf. FULLBACKUPDAY below)
# plus optionally several differential backups that get created by subsequent "rear mkbackup" runs
# where each new differential backup is based on the last existing full backup
# so that "rear recover" will restore first the latest full backup that exists
# plus one single latest differential backup that was made after the latest full backup.
# Incremental and differential backup is implemented via the 'tar' option '--newer=YYYY-MM-DD'
# so that only files whose modification or status change timestamp is newer than YYYY-MM-DD
# get included in the incremental or differential backup.
# In particular files that have been deleted since the last backup are not recognized this way
# so that such files will get falsely restored during "rear recover".
# Because of '--newer=YYYY-MM-DD' the timing granularity for incremental and differential backup
# is one day and the differentiating time is at 00:00 on YYYY-MM-DD.
# This means in particular for a series of incremental backups that happen each day at e.g. 05:00
# that all files with modification or status change timestamp between 00:00 and 05:00
# get included in two subsequent incremental backups, e.g. in 2017-11-22-0500-I.tar.gz
# and in 2017-11-23-0500-I.tar.gz because 2017-11-23-0500-I.tar.gz includes all files
# that are newer than 2017-11-22 at 00:00 (the date of the last incremental backup at 00:00)
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1285 for details.
# In general regarding advanced backup functionality (like incremental and differential backup):
# ReaR is primarily a disaster recovery tool to recreate the basic system after a disaster happened.
# ReaR is neither a backup software nor a backup management software and it is not meant to be one
# (cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery).
# In particular do not expect too much from ReaR's internal backup methods like 'tar'.
# For simple tasks ReaR's internal backup methods should be o.k. but
# ReaR's internal backup methods are not meant as professional backup solutions.
# In general the backup and restore of the files is "external functionality" for ReaR.
# ReaR only calls an external tool and that tool does the backup and restore of the files.
# Use a professional backup solution in particular when you need advanced backup functionality.
BACKUP_TYPE=
# Together with BACKUP_TYPE=incremental or BACKUP_TYPE=differential
# you could define on which weekdays "rear mkbackup" will create a full backup.
# If FULLBACKUPDAY is set a full backup will be done on each of the weekdays in the FULLBACKUPDAY array
# in any case (regardless if there already exists a full backup that was created on the same day).
# For example FULLBACKUPDAY=( Sun Wed ) makes a full backup on each Sunday and Wednesday.
# The weekday values must match the output of "date +%a" run in the POSIX/C locale
# (/usr/sbin/rear sets that locale) i.e. it must be an English abbreviated weekday.

FULLBACKUPDAY=()
# Together with BACKUP_TYPE=incremental or BACKUP_TYPE=differential
# you could define when an existing full backup is considered to be too old
# so that "rear mkbackup" will create a new full backup.
# ReaR does not remove any backup (the admin can do it deliberately and manually)
# so that in particular too old backups are not removed.
# By default an existing full backup is considered to be too old

# to have the recovery system better prepared for somewhat
# "unusual use cases" where this or that additional kernel module
# is needed (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202),
# e.g. to ensure a USB keyboard is usable in the recovery system

# or to ensure data on external medium (e.g. iso9660) can be read

# recovery system (and its ISO image) somewhat bigger,
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2041 for some numbers.
# To get the recovery system smaller by leaving out kernel modules
# the following settings can be specified:
# An empty MODULES=() setting means that the currently loaded
# kernel modules get included in the recovery system
# (so that recovery should work on same replacement hardware)
# plus some kernel modules that should always be included
# (see build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh)
# plus kernel modules for certain kernel drivers like
# storage drivers, network drivers, crypto drivers,
# virtualization drivers, and some extra drivers
# (see rescue/GNU/Linux/230_storage_and_network_modules.sh
# and rescue/GNU/Linux/240_kernel_modules.sh). Usually this
# works reasonably well but no automatism works in any case
# so that more explicit user settings are possible via
# MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' ) where additional kernel modules
# can be specified to be included in the recovery system
# in addition to the ones via an empty MODULES=() setting.
# Normally other required kernel modules are usually also
# automatically included but this may not work in any case
# (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355).
# The setting MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' ) results that
# only those kernel modules that are currently loaded
# get included in the recovery system. This results a noticeable
# smaller recovery system but on the other hand it means that
# recovery will only work on same replacement hardware.
# The very special setting MODULES=( 'no_modules' ) enforces that
# no kernel modules at all get included in the recovery system
# regardless of what modules are currently loaded. Usually this
# means that the recovery system will not work - unless
# you have all needed kernel drivers compiled into your kernel.
MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
#
# Enforce to load these modules in the given order in the rescue/recovery system.
# We also load modules listed in /etc/modules. The order is 1) /etc/modules and
# 2) MODULES_LOAD and 3) modules loaded by udev or systemd. ReaR also takes the list
# of modules from your initrd and adds that to MODULES_LOAD.

# Kernel modules to exclude from the rescue/recovery system.
# Modules that are specified in EXCLUDE_MODULES are excluded

# By default we exclude scsi_debug - see issue #626:
EXCLUDE_MODULES=( scsi_debug )

# Firmware files to include in the rescue/recovery system.
# The FIRMWARE_FILES array contains filename globbing patterns
# that are used as '-ipath' arguments for 'find' calls to find
# firmware files in the /lib*/firmware/ directories that will
# get included in the rescue/recovery system for example like
# FIRMWARE_FILES=( '*rtl*' '*nvidia*' '*radeon*' )
# The special value FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' ) or any value that
# is recognized as 'no' by the is_false function enforces that
# no files from the /lib*/firmware/ directories get included
# in the rescue/recovery system.
# The special value FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'yes' ) or any value that
# is recognized as 'yes' by the is_true function enforces that
# all files from the /lib*/firmware/ directories get included
# in the rescue/recovery system.
# The by default empty FIRMWARE_FILES array means that
# usually all files in the /lib*/firmware/ directories
# get included in the rescue/recovery system but on certain
# architectures like ppc64 or ppc64le the default could be different
# cf. the conf/Linux-ppc64.conf and conf/Linux-ppc64le.conf scripts:

# Files and directories to copy as-is (with tar) into the ReaR recovery system.
# As its name tells COPY_AS_IS is primarily meant to "only copy as is".
# In particular tar does not follow symlinks when copying
# (for the reason behind see the build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh script).
# To get libraries into the recovery system, use the LIBS array.
# To get non-mandatory programs into the recovery system, use the PROGS array.
# To get mandatory programs into the recovery system, use the REQUIRED_PROGS array.
# For elements in the LIBS, PROGS, and REQUIRED_PROGS arrays
# the RequiredSharedObjects function is called to determine required
# shared objects (libraries) that get also copied into the recovery system.
# For what is specified via the COPY_AS_IS array there is an exception to the
# above "only copy as is" rule that for executables RequiredSharedObjects is called
# to also get their needed libraries copied into the recovery system.
# But when libraries are specified via COPY_AS_IS that are not executable
# no required other libraries get automatically copied into the recovery system.
# The reasoning behind is when programs are specified via COPY_AS_IS they
# should be handled gracefully but COPY_AS_IS is not meant for libraries.
# The drawback of calling RequiredSharedObjects for all executables is that
# RequiredSharedObjects calls ldd to determine the required shared objects
# but some versions of ldd do this by executing the executable (see "man ldd")
# which could lead to the execution of arbitrary programs as user 'root'
# in particular when directories are specified in COPY_AS_IS that may contain
# unexpected files like programs from arbitrary (possibly untrusted) users
# so for example COPY_AS_IS+=( /home/JohnDoe ) could be a rather bad idea.
# To mitigate those possible ldd security issues RequiredSharedObjects calls ldd
# only for files that are onwed by the trusted users in TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS.
# Usually globbing patterns in COPY_AS_IS are specified without quoting
# like COPY_AS_IS+=( /whole/directory/ /directory_symlink/* /path/to/files* )
# so that the bash pathname expansion works as usually intended
# (for details see the build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh script).
# To copy contents of directory symlinks /directory_symlink/* can be used.
# Because copying happens by calling tar ... ${COPY_AS_IS[*]}
# (for the reason behind see the build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh script)
# files or directories that contain blanks or other $IFS characters cannot be specified
# but their parent directory can be specified if it does not contain $IFS characters.
# Because usr/sbin/rear sets the nullglob option globbing patterns
# like /path/to/files* expand to nothing if no file matches.
COPY_AS_IS=( $SHARE_DIR $VAR_DIR )
# Things to exclude from being copied into the ReaR recovery system:
# /var/lib/rear/output is useless in the recovery system and may contain huge files in particular
# an old recovery system image (e.g. an ISO image) from a previous "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" run.
# If that was re-included in the current recovery system each run of "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"
# would generate a bigger recovery system that recursively contains all previous recovery systems.
# /dev/.udev contains runtime things for udev (e.g. the temporary rules directory /dev/.udev/rules.d)
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f57be9070cb8ad8692497d0baedf364b47ac7a8d

# KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY specifies the default directory for keyboard mapping files.
# Different Linux distributions use a different default directory for keymaps,

# so that we have this summary:
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps is used by SUSE and Arch Linux
#   /usr/share/keymaps is used by Debian and Ubuntu
#   /lib/kbd/keymaps is used by Centos and Fedora and Red Hat
# By default (i.e. when KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY is not set or empty)
# it uses the first one of those directories that exist:
KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=""
# KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES is a string of directories that contain keyboard mapping files
# or plain keyboard mapping files to be included in the recovery system, for example like
# KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES="/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/defkeymap.map"
# The main intent is to support non-US keyboards because without a right keyboard mapping
# it could become an awful annoyance to work in the recovery system.
# When KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES is specified it is not sufficient to include
# e.g. only a '/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/' sub-directory because
# include files in '/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/include/' are also needed.
# For example to find out what 'loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys' needs one may run
# "strace -f -e open loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys" and inspect its output
# which keymap files are used which results e.g. on openSUSE Leap 42.3 those files:
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1.map.gz
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/qwertz-layout.inc
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/compose.inc
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/linux-with-alt-and-altgr.inc
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/linux-keys-bare.inc
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/euro2.map.gz
#   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/include/compose.latin1
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781#issuecomment-384574103
# Specifying those files in KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES results a minimal recovery system
# that contains only what is needed to use the de-latin1-nodeadkeys keyboard mapping.
# In some cases (e.g. on ppc64 with the yaboot bootloader) a minimal recovery system
# is required (cf. the section about REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION below).
# By default (i.e. when KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES is not set or empty)
# the whole KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY is included to be on the safe side and
# to get a recovery system that can be used with various usual keyboards:
KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES=""
# KEYMAP is a keymap file to be set via 'loadkeys $KEYMAP' in the recovery system
# to specify the exact keymap that should be set and used for example like:
# KEYMAP="de-latin1-nodeadkeys"
# During recovery system startup with topmost priority it tries to set
# what is specified as KEYMAP but that may fail when needed keymap files
# are missing in the recovery system (e.g. include files, see above).
# With second priority it tries to set the keymap of the original system
# which was dumped during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup", for details
# see the rescue/GNU/Linux/500_clone_keyboard_mappings.sh script.
# As fallback it tries to set the default 'defkeymap' (US keyboad) keymap.
# Be default (i.e. when KEYMAP is not set or empty) the keymap of the original system
# while "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" was run is also used in the recovery system:
KEYMAP=""

# Users and groups to copy into the ReaR recovery system.
# Users and groups must exist in the original system (i.e. one cannot create new ones).
# Specified users and groups that do not exist in the original system are ignored.
# Users and groups must be specified with names (not with numerical IDs):
CLONE_USERS=()
CLONE_GROUPS=()
CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="true"
# When CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS is 'true' or 'all' copy users and groups
# that exist on the current system into the ReaR recovery system
# in addition to the users and groups in CLONE_USERS and CLONE_GROUPS.
# When CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS contains a 'true' value, copy the users and groups
# from the local /etc/passwd and /etc/group files into the recovery system.
# To exclude users and groups set CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="false" and specify
# the users and groups via CLONE_USERS and CLONE_GROUPS as needed.
# If /etc/passwd or /etc/group on the original system contain secrets
# (in particular passwords) the secrets get copied into the recovery system.
# The /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow files are not copied into the recovery system
# so that shadow passwords should not appear in the recovery system
# unless explicitly specified e.g. via COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/shadow )
# When CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS is 'all', copy also all users and groups that are
# available via 'getent' on the original system into the recovery system.
# For details see the usr/share/rear/rescue/default/900_clone_users_and_groups.sh script.
# The default CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="true" should normally be sufficient
# that all files from the backup can be restored with right user and group.
# If the original file's user and group does not exist in the recovery system
# that file from the backup might get restored with wrong user or group name
# (e.g. with the fallback 'root:root') or with wrong numerical user ID or group ID
# because the backup restore software runs "inside" the recovery system with the
# users and groups there and not with the users and groups of the original system.
# Therefore special users and groups can be added via CLONE_USERS and CLONE_GROUPS
# or even CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="all" can be specified.

# A terminal login password as a salted hash.
# If empty, a root login into the ReaR recovery system via the system console or a serial terminal

#    - 'openssl passwd -1', otherwise (see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2455#discussion_r453613086 for information
#      on the implications of its cryptographic weakness),
# 2. copy its entire output line and insert it between the single quotes of the following line:
#        { TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD=''; } 2>/dev/null
#    NOTE: stderr is redirected in the above line to avoid exposing the password hash
#          in the log file when ReaR runs in debugscript mode.

# SSH_FILES
# SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD
# SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS
#
# What SSH files should be copied into the ReaR rescue/recovery system and
# how SSH access in the ReaR rescue/recovery system should be set up.
#
# This configuration only affects the rescue/recovery system.
# A system restored by ReaR will receive its SSH configuration entirely from its backup.
# ReaR supports OpenSSH versions >= 3.1 and SSH files at standard locations.
#
# When a different secure shell software is used set SSH_FILES='no'
# to disable the SSH setup functionality in ReaR and specify the
# files and programs that are needed for remote access in the
# rescue/recovery system via generic ReaR functionality like
# COPY_AS_IS, REQUIRED_PROGS, COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE, and LIBS.
#
# When SSH_FILES is set to 'no', nothing is done to set up SSH
# (in particular no sshd setup) in the rescue/recovery system.
#
# For a rescue system/medium free of secrets, use the default configuration:
# You can access the rescue system's root account via SSH via public/private key
# if that was permitted on the original system (via authorized_keys).
# Accessing other systems from the rescue system via SSH requires entering a password
# (as there are no private keys on the rescue medium).
#
# To support added functionality on the running rescue system is possible
# at the price of having the rescue system/medium contain secrets
# so that the rescue system ISO image and any recovery medium
# needs to be protected against unwanted access.
# To access the rescue system with a password, set SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD.
# To access other systems via root's passphrase-protected SSH private keys
# present on the original system, set SSH_FILES='yes'.
# To access other systems via root's protected and unprotected SSH private keys
# present on the original system, set SSH_FILES='yes' and SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS='yes'.
#
# For special needs, you have these options:
# You can specify the SSH configuration files individually by setting SSH_FILES to an array,
# whose elements are the file paths.
# Elements of this array receive special key protection if configured.
# You can use COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE to exclude files from being copied.
#
# SSH host key files can be generated anew only for the recovery system.
# provided SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS is not set to a 'false' value
# because private host keys are never protected.
# If there are no SSH host key files in the recovery system, a fallback RSA key
# is generated when starting sshd during recovery system startup and
# the RSA key fingerprint is shown on the recovery system login screen.
#
# For details see rescue/default/500_ssh.sh build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh
# build/default/501_check_ssh_keys.sh and skel/default/etc/scripts/run-sshd
#
# The default SSH_FILES='avoid_sensitive_files' should be secure
# because it avoids copying sensitive SSH files as follows:
# From /etc/ssh only moduli, ssh_config, sshd_config, and ssh_known_hosts are copied and
# from /root/.ssh only authorized_keys and known_hosts are copied into the recovery system.
SSH_FILES='avoid_sensitive_files'
#
# SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD defines a password for remote access to the recovery system as 'root' via SSH
# without requiring a public/private key pair. This password is valid only while the recovery system
# is running and will not allow access afterwards to the restored target system.
# In the recovery system the password is stored in hashed MD5 format (do not forget the password).
# Both SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='plain_text_password' and SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='hashed_password' are possible.
# To avoid a plain text password in the etc/rear/local.conf config file
# generate a hashed password with the command
#   echo 'my_recovery_system_root_password' | openssl passwd -1 -stdin
# and use the output of openssl to set SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='output_of_openssl'
# (single quotes avoid issues with the special bash character $ in the openssl output).
# SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD is ignored when SSH_FILES is set to a 'false' value.
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD=
#
# SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS="yes" makes ReaR also include SSH keys without a passphrase
# in the ReaR rescue/recovery system at the price of having the rescue system/medium
# contain secrets so that the rescue system ISO image and any recovery medium
# needs to be protected against unwanted access.
# This is not recommended because usually ReaR should build a recovery system ISO image
# that does not contain secrets from the original system so that a recovery medium that
# is created from the recovery system ISO image does not need to be specially protected.
# Instead of enabling this consider creating additional SSH keys with passphrases to be used
# only during recovery. You can even have the same key, once with and once without passphrase.
# The one without will be used during regular operations and the one with passphrase
# on the ReaR rescue/recovery system.
# With the default SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS="no" ReaR tries to find SSH keys
# without passphrase for root (but not for other users) at standard locations
# and if found ReaR removes those unprotected keys from the recovery system.
# But SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS="no" is not at all any guarantee
# to not have any kind of unprotected SSH key in the recovery system.
# In general to check if there are unwanted files in the recovery system
# use KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes" and inspect the recovery system content
# in $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/ and use COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE
# to exclude unwanted files from the recovery system.

# What programs/binaries (i.e. files in a /bin/ or /sbin/ directory)
# are o.k. in the ReaR rescue/recovery system regardless
# that 'ldd' reports a 'not found' library for them.
# In general the right solution when 'ldd' reports a 'not found' library
# is to use the generic config variables COPY_AS_IS REQUIRED_PROGS and LIBS
# to get actually missing stuff into the ReaR rescue/recovery system or
# for external/third-party backup programs the specific config variables
# like COPY_AS_IS_TSM COPY_AS_IS_BORG COPY_AS_IS_YUM and others.
# NON_FATAL_BINARIES_WITH_MISSING_LIBRARY is a 'egrep' pattern
# like NON_FATAL_BINARIES_WITH_MISSING_LIBRARY='myprog|/mydir/'
# where it is known that things work regardless of what 'ldd' reports.
# By default it is fatal when 'ldd' reports a 'not found' library for
# any file in a /bin/ or /sbin/ directory in the recovery system and

# and stores the result as /md5sums.txt in the ReaR rescue/recovery system.
# During recovery system startup the md5sums of the files in /md5sums.txt are verified.
# The reason behind is that there could be errors during loading/unpacking
# of the initrd/initramfs which are reported (if one knows how to look for them)
# but at least some errors do not abort the boot process so that
# it could happen that files in the recovery system are corrupt
# but the user may not notice the actual error and get any kind
# of inexplicable errors later when using the recovery system,
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859

# EXCLUDE_MD5SUM_VERIFICATION is a 'egrep -v' pattern

# for files or directories in md5sums.txt that should be excluded from being verified.
# With the special value EXCLUDE_MD5SUM_VERIFICATION='all'

# In this case you may set LUKS_CRYPTSETUP_OPTIONS="--iter-time 2000 --use-urandom" instead
# but using /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random results a low-quality master encryption key.

# when your LUKS password does not match the cryptsetup password quality checking requirements.
# Another example could be something like LUKS_CRYPTSETUP_OPTIONS+=" --align-payload 4096"
# to enforce a 4096 * 512 bytes = 2 MiB alignment of the data payload (without LUKS header)
# when e.g. 2 MiB alignment of the LUKS data payload is actually used on the original system.
# This could be needed in particular when LUKS volumes are used as containers for higher level
# storage objects like LVM on top of LUKS encrypted volumes to have LUKS encryption for LVM.
# When "rear recover" is done on a different replacement disk it could happen that the
# cryptsetup default data payload alignment (which is based on the topology of the new disk)
# recreates LUKS volumes with a bigger alignment value that results less data payload size
# compared to what it was on the original system which could let a subsequent LVM setup fail
# when a specified LVM volume size does no longer fit into a smaller LUKS data payload area,
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2389

# BACKUP=NETFS stuff
##
# NETFS is an internal backup method that saves the backup into a mounted directory.
# This is usually a network share, but can also be used to create a backup to a local
# disk (by providing your own BACKUP_MOUNTCMD and BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD commands that mount the
# local disk. Please note that a backup to a local disk is not a disaster recovery backup.
#
# NETFS saves the system to a network file system. Supported are all filesystems that your
# system can handle, for some exotic filesystems you might have to extend Relax-and-Recover
# to correctly handle the URL or provide custom mount/umount commands.
#
# A BACKUP_URL backup target location is required for BACKUP=NETFS
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1532#issuecomment-336810460
# so that it is an error to use BACKUP=NETFS without a BACKUP_URL.
#
# Prefix directory to create under the network filesystem share:
NETFS_PREFIX="$HOSTNAME"
#
# Keep an older copy of the backup (mv $NETFS_PREFIX $NETFS_PREFIX.old before we copy the new version)
# empty means only keep current backup:
NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=
#
# NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES is an array that contains those directories
# where ReaR should save file capabilities via 'getcap -r' (during 'rear mkbackup') and
# restore them for each file with file capabilities via 'setcap' (during 'rear recover').
# The special value NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES=( 'Yes' ) results that 'getcap -r /'
# is used as fallback which could become unusable slow on systems with zillions of files
# in particular when tons of stuff is mounted cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283
# In this case one must explicitly specify on what directories 'getcap -r' should be run.
# NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES should usually contain those directories that are in the backup.
# The default NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES=( 'No' ) means that
# the backup program should save and restore file capabilities
# (e.g. 'tar' via '--xattr' that is used by default in ReaR).
# For backup program that do not support to save and restore file capabilities
# the user can manually specify NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES as a workaround
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1175
# Furthermore BUILD_DIR (i.e. usually /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX cf. TMPDIR above) and
# ISO_DIR are automatically excluded cf. rescue/NETFS/default/610_save_capabilities.sh

# BACKUP=RSYNC method
##
# RSYNC backup method uses rsync (using ssh or rsync) to make a backup to a remote network server
# prefix directory to create on the remote network filesystem
# default prefix is the short hostname
RSYNC_PREFIX="$HOSTNAME"
# RSYNC_PROTOCOL_VERSION=29 when rsync version <3.0, or 30 for newer releases (is auto-detected,
# but if you move from one rsync server to another it might become handy to known about this var)
RSYNC_PROTOCOL_VERSION=
# The BACKUP_URL contains the source or destination path of the remote rsync server (ssh, rsync protocol)
# Note: please exchange the SSH keys to avoid password prompts
# BACKUP_URL is mandatory with RSYNC
# BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using ssh
# BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]::/PATH  # using rsync
#
# The default rsync options passed (more can/will be added according workflow)
# You can use this variable to add your own options, e.g.
# BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( --devices --acls )

# BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE stuff
##
# This mode interrupts "rear recover" after formatting and mounting the filesystems
# and expects the backup data was properly restored to continue "rear recover"
# so you have to do something to restore your backup manually before continuing.
# For example this mode could be used with servers that are saved with RBME (RSYNC BACKUP MADE EASY)
# and the backup restore is done manually by pushing the files back via rsync/ssh.
# The latter requires that SSH (in particular sshd) works in the ReaR recovery system.
# For details see the restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/200_prompt_user_to_start_restore.sh script.
#
# The text to display in order to prompt the user to restore the backup data:
REQUESTRESTORE_TEXT="Please start the restore process on your backup host.
Make sure that you restore the data into $TARGET_FS_ROOT (by default '/mnt/local')
instead of '/' because the hard disks of the recovered system are mounted there.
"
#
# This command is shown to the user and added to the predefined bash history
# in the ReaR recovery system to make the manual backup restore easier:
REQUESTRESTORE_COMMAND=

##
# BACKUP=RBME
##
# This mode allows restoring a RBME backup from NFS shares.
# As NFSv4 is not fully supported with ReaR (yet) it is safer to
# use BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock" in the local.conf file.
# Note: You may have to open appropriate TCP/UDP ports on the NFS server (iptables).
#
# Configure the RBME backup ahead of time.
# RBME will present you a list of all backups that are available.
# A magic value of 'latest' will automatically use the latest backup.

# If the RBME hostname is different from the system hostname, configure it here
# Example: RBME_HOSTNAME="$HOSTNAME-bcp"
RBME_HOSTNAME=$HOSTNAME

# BACKUP=ZYPPER
##
# It is not an usual file-based backup/restore method
# where one gets the files of an old system back as they had been before.
# This new kind of "backup" method does not work on files but on RPM packages
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1085
# and https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/2242
# During "rear mkbackup" it will basically only save a list of installed RPM packages
# into var/lib/rear/backup/ZYPPER/installed_RPM_packages and during "rear recover" it will basically
# only install those RPM packages as pristine RPM packages from those zypper repositories
# that are specified in ZYPPER_REPOSITORIES or in a var/lib/rear/backup/ZYPPER/zypper_repositories.repo file.
# Any other files that should be restored (e.g. prepared config files or /home directories)
# must be done by "Using Multiple Backups for Relax-and-Recover", see
# doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc
##
# For each member zypper_repository in the ZYPPER_REPOSITORIES array the following command is called
#   zypper --root $TARGET_FS_ROOT addrepo $zypper_repository ...
# which means each array member in ZYPPER_REPOSITORIES must be a valid zypper repository URI,
# see what "zypper repos -u" shows as URI and what "zypper repos -e -" results and see "man zypper".
# The by default empty ZYPPER_REPOSITORIES array means that during "rear mkbackup" the command
#   zypper repos --export var/lib/rear/backup/ZYPPER/zypper_repositories.repo
# is run (var/lib/rear/backup/ZYPPER/zypper_repositories.repo gets included in the ReaR recovery system) and
# when during "rear recover" in the ReaR recovery system /var/lib/rear/backup/ZYPPER/zypper_repositories.repo exists
#   zypper --root $TARGET_FS_ROOT addrepo --repo /var/lib/rear/backup/ZYPPER/zypper_repositories.repo
# is run in the ReaR recovery system so that by default during "rear recover" the same
# zypper repositories are used as in the original system. A precondition for that is
# that during "rear recover" those zypper repositories are somehow "just accessible".
# ReaR has nothing implemented to make zypper repositories accessible.
# If that precondition is not fulfilled one must explicitly specify in /etc/rear/local.conf
# the ZYPPER_REPOSITORIES array with appropriate valid zypper repository URI value(s)
# that are "just accessible" during "rear recover".

# by other RPM packages on the original system get re-installed on the target system

# RPM packages that are not required by other RPMs are independently installed RPM packages.
# The list of independently installed RPMs is stored during "rear mkbackup" by default in
# var/lib/rear/backup/ZYPPER/independent_RPMs
# Independently installed RPM packages are those that
# either are intentionally installed by the admin (the ones that are really wanted)

# BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY
#
# Move away restored files or directories that should not have been restored:
#
# Do not confuse it with EXCLUDE_RESTORE in the EXCLUDES section below.
# With EXCLUDE_RESTORE items are excluded during backup restore
# where each particular backup method must explicitly implement support
# for the EXCLUDE_RESTORE functionality (most do not support it).
# In contrast BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY works generically
# for any backup restore method.
#
# See https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/779
#
# After backup restore ReaR should move away files or directories
# that should not have been restored - mainly files or directories
# that are created and maintained by system tools where
# a restore from the backup results wrong/outdated
# content that conflicts with the actual system.
#
# The generic traditional example of such a file was /etc/mtab.
# As long as it was a regular file it must not have been restored
# with outdated content from a backup. Nowadays it is a symbolic link
# to /proc/self/mounts which should probably be restored to ensure
# that link is available.
#
# ReaR will not remove any file (any user data is sacrosanct).
# Instead ReaR moves those files away into a ReaR-specific directory
# so that the admin can inspect that directory to see what ReaR thinks
# should not have been restored:
readonly BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY="$VAR_DIR/moved_away_after_backup_restore/"
#
# There is nothing hardcoded in the scripts.
# Instead BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES is a documented list
# that explains why each file or directory is moved away.
# The BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is not readonly
# so that it can be modified as needed by the scripts.
# The items in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list do not need to be only files.
# Also a whole directory tree can be moved away (automatically recursively).
# If an item in BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES is a directory only its content
# is (recursively) removed but the original (empty) directory is kept because
# the empty directory alone should not cause issues and usually only the content
# is what results wrong/outdated content that conflicts with the actual system
# or what is no longer needed after system recovery (e.g. content in /var/tmp
# is probably no longer needed but the /var/tmp directory is still needed).
# Already existing stuff in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY that would be (partially)
# overwritten by the items in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is removed before
# (because such stuff is considered as outdated leftover e.g. from a previous recovery)
# but already existing stuff in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY that is not
# in the curent BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is kept.
# Example:
# Probably stuff in the /var/tmp directory is not needed after a system recovery
# and /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules is created and maintained
# by systemd/udev (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770):
# BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /var/tmp /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )
#
# Move away outdated information from previous boot via GRUB2
# to avoid a possible GRUB2 "error: invalid environment block."
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828
# GRUB2 can use /boot/grub/grubenv or /boot/grub2/grubenv
# to remember a small amount of information from one boot to the next.
# But on a by "rear recover" recreated system there is no such thing
# as a meaningful previous boot (because "rear recover" recreates a system
# by reinstalling it completely from scratch) so that there is no meaningful
# use-case to remember any information from a possible previous boot,
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-399050741
# Nevertheless that information from the last boot on the original system
# could be still of interest for the user so that it is not deleted:
BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /boot/grub/grubenv /boot/grub2/grubenv )

##
# DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER
#
# Create still missing directories and symbolic links
# after the backup was restored
# (by the 900_create_missing_directories.sh script).
#
# For background information and reasoning see
# https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1455#issuecomment-324904017
# that reads:
#   Typical backup software assumes that the restore always happens
#   on top of a system that was installed the traditional way,
#   so that for the backup software it is safe to assume that
#   those directories are present. From the perspective
#   of the backup software there is therefore no need
#   to include such directories in a full backup.
#   Bottom line is, it is the duty of ReaR to make sure
#   that these special directories really do exist.
#
# By default a directories_permissions_owner_group file
# (named $VAR_DIR/recovery/directories_permissions_owner_group)
# is created by the 400_save_directories.sh script
# that saves permissions, owner, group of basic directories
# plus symbolic link names and targets of basic directories.
# The basic directories are those that are currently used as mountpoints
# plus the directories of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
# as listed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
# provided such a directory actually exists on the system
# but mountpoints of mounted 'pseudofs' filesystems are
# considered as unwanted "noise" and get excluded
# (for details see the 400_save_directories.sh script).
#
# Via the DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER array additional directories
# and symbolic links that should be created can be specified.
# For each directory or symbolic link DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER
# contains an array member which is a string that specifies
# the directory or symbolic link with the following syntax:
# A directory is specified as 'directory [ mode [ owner [ group ] ] ]'
# where mode, owner, and group are optional in the following way:
# When no mode is specified the default 'rwxr-xr-x root root' is used.
# When owner should be specified also mode must be specified.
# When no owner is specified the default 'root root' is used.
# When group should be specified also mode and owner must be specified.
# When owner is specified but no group then group is set same as the owner
# so that this way e.g. 'lp lp' can be abbreviated to only 'lp'.
# A symbolic link is specified as 'symlink_name -> symlink_target'.
# Example:
# DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER=( '/path/to/mytmpdir 1770 myowner mygroup' '/var/mytmpdir -> /path/to/mytmpdir' )
# By default the DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER array is empty:
DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER=()

# How to exclude something ----- EXCLUDES -------
#
# You cannot exclude a device (e.g. /dev/sdg) directly. Instead you have to exclude everything
# ON that device and then the dependency tracker will automatically exclude the device from the
# recovery (because there won't be any recovery information for that "unnecessary" device).
#
# Furthermore, you have to exclude MD devices and LVM2 volume groups separately
# as there is no automatic detection of these dependencies.

# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. Will be automatically added to the
# $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array during backup to prevent the excluded filesystems' data to
# be backed up
# examples: /tmp
#           /media/bigdisk
EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()

# Exclude MD devices
# examples: /dev/md0
#           /dev/md/0
EXCLUDE_MD=()

# Exclude LVM2 volume groups. This will automatically exclude also the creation of the
# corresponding physical and logical volumes that belong to the excluded volume group.
# You must also exclude the corresponding mountpoints in EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS (see above)
# otherwise "rear recover" would try to recreate the filesystems onto non-existing LVs.
EXCLUDE_VG=()

# Exclude any component from the recovery image.
# Some component types need a prefix:
# - filesystems: "fs:/var/cache"
# - physical volumes: "pv:/dev/sda2"
# - swap: "swap:/dev/mapper/system-swap"
# Volume groups look like: "/dev/system".
# If in doubt about the correct syntax, consult /var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf
EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=()

####
# Only include LVM2 volume groups - the opposite of EXCLUDE_VG (handy if you only want vg00 to be included)
# EXCLUDE_VG and EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS will get populated automatically, if needed
# syntax : e.g. ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" "vg01" )
ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=()

# Automatically exclude disks that are not used by mounted filesystems

# GRUB_RESCUE [ GRUB_RESCUE_USER ]
#
# Add a ReaR rescue/recovery system to the bootloader of the currently running system.
# With BIOS a ReaR rescue system is added to the GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader of the currently running system.
# With UEFI a ReaR rescue system is added to the EFI boot manager of the currently running system.
# UEFI is only supported with GRUB2. GRUB_RESCUE with UEFI and GRUB is not supported.
# It adds kernel and ReaR initrd to the bootloader directory in the currently running system.
# It adds a 'Relax-and-Recover' boot entry to boot that locally installed ReaR rescue system.
# With BIOS a 'Relax-and-Recover' boot entry is added to the GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader menu.
# With UEFI a 'Relax-and-Recover' boot entry is added to the EFI boot manager.
# With UEFI there is no 'Relax-and-Recover' boot entry in the GRUB2 bootloader menu
# (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/954 and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2545).
# Note that GRUB_RESCUE is the only functionality where "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue"
# changes the currently running system. It changes the currently running system even
# in a critical way because it changes the bootloader of the currently running system.
# The main reason for the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is to be quickly able to recover a system
# from soft errors (like deleting all of /lib/) without digging out the ReaR recovery boot medium.
# When booting that locally installed ReaR recovery system it does the same as when booting
# the ReaR recovery system from an external ReaR boot medium - i.e. "rear recover" replaces the
# whole current system with a recreated system where all files are restored from the backup.
# To be on the safe side the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is disabled by default:
GRUB_RESCUE=n
# Optional password protection via GRUB_RESCUE_USER only works for GRUB2 with BIOS.
# GRUB_RESCUE_USER is not supported for UEFI (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/954).
# GRUB2 password protection requires an existing GRUB2 user with a password.
# If the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is enabled (e.g. via GRUB_RESCUE=y in /etc/rear/local.conf)
# a non-empty GRUB_RESCUE_USER can be optionally set to get GRUB2 password protection
# for the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menu entry.
# When GRUB_RESCUE_USER is non-empty it must specify an already configured GRUB2 user
# except the special value 'unrestricted' is set via GRUB_RESCUE_USER="unrestricted"
# which creates the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menu entry so that it can be booted by anyone
# which means anyone who can boot the currently running system can replace it via "rear recover".
# When GRUB_RESCUE_USER is empty ReaR does not do a GRUB2 user related setup
# so that the already existing GRUB2 users configuration determines
# which users can boot the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menu entry.
# Usually this means anyone can boot 'Relax-and-Recover' which means anyone
# who can boot the currently running system can replace it via "rear recover".
GRUB_RESCUE_USER=""
# The former GRUB2 superuser setup support in ReaR via GRUB_SUPERUSER is dropped and
# also the former GRUB2 password setup support in ReaR via GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD is dropped.
# Both kind of setup can change the behaviour of the GRUB2 bootloader as a whole in unexpected ways
# but ReaR is not meant to change the general GRUB2 configuration of the currently running system.
# It works by default reasonably backward compatible when formerly a GRUB_SUPERUSER was used
# which means a GRUB2 superuser was set up by ReaR in /etc/grub.d/01_users with GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD
# so that the empty GRUB_RESCUE_USER results that the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menu entry
# can only be booted by the formerly set GRUB_SUPERUSER with the formerly set GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD.

# REBUILD_INITRAMFS
#
# Whether or not the initramfs/initrd should be rebuild during "rear recover"
# in the recreated system.
# The default REBUILD_INITRAMFS="yes" rebuilds the initramfs/initrd in any case
# to be on the safe side because ReaR cannot check/verify all possible reasons
# why the initramfs/initrd may have to be rebuild in the recreated system.
# In special cases the user can explicitly skip rebuilding the initramfs/initrd in any case
# via REBUILD_INITRAMFS="no" (or any value that is recognized as 'no' by the is_false function)
# which usually means the initramfs/initrd that was restored form the backup gets used "as is"
# but that can lead to errors later when booting the recreated system.
# An empty value REBUILD_INITRAMFS="" (or any value that is neither recognized as 'yes'
# by the is_true function nor as 'no' by the is_false function) specifies the old behaviour
# where "rear recover" rebuilds the initrd/initramfs only if some storage drivers changed
# (cf. 260_storage_drivers.sh and 260_recovery_storage_drivers.sh) but in general
# that is insufficient (there are other reasons why the initramfs/initrd must be rebuild)

# BOOTLOADER
#
# What kind of bootloader is used on the original system
# (i.e. the bootloader that should be reinstalled during "rear recover").
# The by default empty BOOTLOADER means that ReaR will try to autodetect
# what bootloader is used on the original system.
# Specifying BOOTLOADER is only meant so that the user can if needed
# (in particular when the bootloader autodetection fails for him)
# enforce ReaR to set up during "rear recover" one of its supported bootloaders
# (i.e. one of what is listed in layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh).
# What is currently listed in layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
# is: GRUB2-EFI EFI GRUB2 GRUB ELILO LILO PPC ARM ARM-ALLWINNER ZIPL
# - ARM is a dummy that does nothing, as on Raspberry Pi and most TI devices you just need
#   to include the first FAT partition (with the MLO or bootcode.bin) in your backup
# - ARM-ALLWINNER is for Allwinner devices and will backup and restore the 2nd stage bootloader
# With an unknown or unsupported bootloader value setting ReaR would fail:

##
# GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES
#
# When GRUB2 is used as bootloader GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES is a string of devices
# where GRUB2 should be installed like GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES="/dev/sda /dev/sdb".
# When GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES is specified, GRUB2 will be installed
# on each grub2_install_device in GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES via a command like
#   chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login -c "grub2-install $grub2_install_device"
# Careful when you use more than one disk like /dev/sda for the system
# plus a USB disk /dev/sdb for the ReaR recovery system and the backup.
# The two disk devices may get interchanged on the replacement hardware
# so that during "rear recover" /dev/sda could be the USB disk.
# In this case GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES="/dev/sda" would install GRUB2
# with the system's GRUB2 configuration on the USB disk which would
# overwrite/destroy the ReaR recovery system bootloader.
# In MIGRATION_MODE disk mappings (in var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
# are applied when devices in GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES match so that enforcing
# MIGRATION_MODE helps to avoid that GRUB2 gets installed on a wrong disk
# when more than one disk is used.
# When GRUB2 is used on POWER architecture e.g. on PPC64 or PPC64LE
# the GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES have to be PPC PReP partition(s).
# On POWER architecture the OpenFirmware is configured to read
# the ELF image embedded in the PReP partition (like how the MBR
# is used by PC-BIOS to embed boot code).
# When GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES is not specified, ReaR tries to automatically determine
# where to install GRUB2 but then the bootloader installation could get wrong.
# For details see the finalize/Linux-i386/620_install_grub2.sh script.
# GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES is set to a default value here only
# if not already set so that the user can set it also via
#   export GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES="/dev/sdb"
# to the right device directly before he calls "rear recover":

# The ReaR rescue/recovery system initrd is loaded by various bootloaders (normally syslinux).
# Usually any bootloader should be able to load any initrd file but then
# the initrd must be usable by the kernel which means a specially compressed initrd
# may not always work, in particular not with older kernels.
# When booting on ppc64 with the yaboot bootloader the initrd must be less than 32MB (or 32MiB?)
# so that in this case the lzma compression could be even required
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142
# In genaral a smaller initrd is loaded faster by the ReaR rescue/recovery system bootloader
# so that a small initrd could make the whole system recovery a bit faster.
# With REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="fast"
# an initrd.cgz with gzip --fast compression is created (fast creating but less compression).
# With REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="best"
# an initrd.cgz with gzip --best compression is created (best gzip compression but slower creating).
# With REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="lzma"
# an initrd.xz with xz using the lzma compression is created (very best compression but very slow).
