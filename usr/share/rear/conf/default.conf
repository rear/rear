#
# Here we define and describe all configuration variables and set them to a default.
#
# Do not change them here. Set them in your site.conf or local.conf file as needed.
#
# Some variables are actually bash arrays and should be treated with care.
# Use VAR=( "${VAR[@]}" value ) to add a value to an array.
# Use VAR=() to set an empty array.
#
# Most variables can be set to an empty value VAR= which means that this
# setting is off or set to some automatic mode.
#
# Boolean variables can be set to anything as we only check wether the variable
# is not empty so that both VAR=yes and VAR=no evaluate to boolean 'true'.
# To set a boolean variable to 'false' set it to an empty value.
#
# A few variables have ternary semantics:
# - explicit true value like True T true t Yes Y yes y 1
# - explicit false value like False F false f No N no n 0
# - unset or empty or a value that is neither a true value nor a false value
# (see the is_true and is_false functions in lib/global-functions.sh).
#
# In case of doubt inspect the scripts how exactly a particular variable works.

##
# TMPDIR
#
# Relax-and-Recover needs a (temporary) working area where it builds in particular
# the rescue/recovery system ISO image (and perhaps even stores the backup archive).
# The directory name of the working area is created in /usr/sbin/rear by calling
#   mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# which usually results /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX or $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# the latter when the canonical Linux/Unix environment variable TMPDIR
# is set in the environment where /usr/sbin/rear is called.
# To have a specific working area directory prefix for Relax-and-Recover
# specify in /etc/rear/local.conf something like
#   export TMPDIR="/prefix/for/rear/working/directory"
# where /prefix/for/rear/working/directory must already exist.
# This is useful for example when there is not sufficient free space
# in /tmp or $TMPDIR for the ISO image or even the backup archive.
# TMPDIR cannot be set to a default value here, otherwise /usr/sbin/rear
# would not work in compliance with the Linux/Unix standards regarding TMPDIR
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968

# You can override autodetection and specify the kernel for the rescue/recovery system:
KERNEL_FILE=""
# The kernel configuration is used to collect the kernel binary and modules.
# It can be set to a different version (e.g. to create a UP rescue media on a SMP system):
KERNEL_VERSION="${KERNEL_VERSION:-$( uname -r )}"
# You can add arbitrary kernel command line parameters when booting the rescue/recovery system
# as you need it (e.g. things like 'console=...' see USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE below).
# Additionally Relax-and-Recover supports the following special kernel command line parameters:
# - 'debug' starts all init-scripts (in /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/ in the rescue/recovery system)
#   in debug mode (via 'set -x') and asks for confirmation before it runs each init-script
#   so that you can skip a script if needed.
# - 'noip' prevents initialization of the networking configuration which is useful when
#   you want to do the networking configuration manually in the rescue/recovery system
#   e.g. to prevent the rescue/recovery system to use the same IP address as the original system
#   but for the latter using USE_DHCLIENT="yes" (see below) is probably easier:

# Relax-and-Recover recovery system update during "rear recover"
#
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841
# and https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects/1508
#
# The by default empty RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL means this functionality is not used so that
# "rear recover" runs as usual without updating any files in the rear recovery system
# (i.e. with the recovery system as "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue" had made it).
#
# If RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL is non-empty it points to a download location
# wherefrom "rear recover" will first of all download a tar.gz archive and
# extract that at the root directory '/' in the rear recovery system.
#
# The intended purpose is to download and replace in the recovery system rear config files
# (usually the content of /etc/rear/ and /var/lib/rear/recovery/ and /var/lib/rear/layout/)
# with updated rear config files.
#
# But it is not limited to replace only rear config files in the recovery system.
# Anything in the tar.gz archive will be extracted at '/' in the recovery system
# (even if it destroys the recovery system) so that it can also be used to update
# anything in the recovery system - provided one does the update carefully.
# For example one should not replace currently running rear scripts.
#
# Currently only a HTTP download location is supported like
#   RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://my_internal_server/$HOSTNAME.rear_config.tgz"
# so that "curl -o recovery-update.tar.gz $RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL" will work.
# Accordingly when using RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://..."
# curl should be added to the REQUIRED_PROGS array like
#   REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" curl )

# local disk. Please note that a backup to a local disk is not a disaster recovery backup.
#
# NETFS saves the system to a network file system. Supported are all filesystems that your

# BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY
#
# Move away restored files or directories that should not have been restored:
#
# Do not confuse it with EXCLUDE_RESTORE in the EXCLUDES section below.
# With EXCLUDE_RESTORE items are excluded during backup restore
# where each particular backup method must explicitly implement support
# for the EXCLUDE_RESTORE functionality (most do not support it).
# In contrast BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY works generically
# for any backup restore method.
#
# See https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/779
#
# After backup restore rear should move away files or directories
# that should not have been restored - maily files or directories
# that are created and maintained by system tools where
# a restore from the backup results wrong/outdated
# content that conflicts with the actual system.
#
# The generic traditional example of such a file was /etc/mtab.
# As long as it was a regular file it must not have been restored
# with outdated content from a backup. Nowadays it is a symbolic link
# to /proc/self/mounts which should probably be restored to ensure
# that link is available.
#
# rear will not remove any file (any user data is sacrosanct).
# Instead rear moves those files away into a rear-specific directory
# so that the admin can inspect that directory to see what rear thinks
# should not have been restored:
readonly BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY="$VAR_DIR/moved_away_after_backup_restore/"
#
# There is nothing hardcoded in the scripts.
# Instead BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES is a documented list
# that explains why each file or directory is moved away.
# The BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is not readonly
# so that it can be modified as needed by the scripts.
# The items in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list do not need to be only files.
# Also a whole directory tree can be moved away (automatically recursively).
# If an item in BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES is a directory only its content
# is (recursively) removed but the original (empty) directory is kept because
# the empty directory alone should not cause issues and usually only the content
# is what results wrong/outdated content that conflicts with the actual system
# or what is no longer needed after system recovery (e.g. content in /var/tmp
# is probably no longer needed but the /var/tmp directory is still needed).
# Already existing stuff in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY that would be (partially)
# overwritten by the items in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is removed before
# (because such stuff is considered as outdated leftover e.g. from a previous recovery)
# but already existing stuff in the BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_DIRECTORY that is not
# in the curent BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES list is kept.
# Example:
# Probably stuff in the /var/tmp directory is not needed after a system recovery
# and /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules is created and maintained
# by systemd/udev (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770):
# BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /var/tmp /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )

# How to exclude something ----- EXCLUDES -------
#
# You cannot exclude a device (e.g. /dev/sdg) directly. Instead you have to exclude everything
# ON that device and then the dependancy tracker will automatically exclude the device from the
# recovery (because there won't be any recovery information for that "unnecessary" device).
#
# Furthermore, you have to exclude MD devices and LVM2 volume groups separately as there is no
# automatic detection of these dependancies (yet, please write and submit it !)

# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. Will be automatically added to the
# $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array during backup to prevent the excluded filesystems' data to
# be backed up
# examples: /tmp

# Exclude LVM2 volume groups. This will automatically exclude also the creation of the corresponding
# physical and logical volumes that belong to the excluded volume group.
#
# NOTE: YOU MUST ALSO EXCLUDE THE CORRESPONDING MOUNTPOINTS IN EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS (see above)
#       OTHERWISE THE RECOVERY ***WILL*** TRY TO RECREATE THE FILESYSTEMS ONTO NON-EXISTING LVs

#       Y O U   H A V E   B E E N   W A R N E D  ! ! !
EXCLUDE_VG=()

# GRUB_RESCUE [ GRUB_RESCUE_USER ]
#
# Add a rear rescue/recovery system to the GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader of the currently running system.
# It adds kernel and the rear initrd to the bootloader directory in the currently running system and
# adds a 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB/GRUB2 menue entry to boot that locally installed rear rescue system.
# Note that GRUB_RESCUE is the only functionality where "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue"
# changes the currently running system. It changes the currently running system even
# in a critical way because it changes the bootloader of the currently running system.
# The main reason for the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is to be quickly able to recover a system
# from soft errors (like deleting all of /lib/) without digging out the rear recovery boot medium.
# When booting that locally installed rear recovery system it does the same as when booting
# the rear recovery system from an external rear boot medium - i.e. "rear recover" replaces the
# whole current system with a recreated system where all files are restored from the backup.
# To be on the safe side the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is disabled by default:
GRUB_RESCUE=n
# Optional password protection via GRUB_RESCUE_USER only works for GRUB2 with Legacy BIOS booting.
# GRUB_RESCUE_USER is not supported for UEFI booting (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/954).
# GRUB2 password protection requires an existing GRUB2 user with a password.
# If the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is enabled (e.g. via GRUB_RESCUE=y in /etc/rear/local.conf)
# a non-empty GRUB_RESCUE_USER can be optionally set to get GRUB2 password protection
# for the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry.
# When GRUB_RESCUE_USER is non-empty it must specify an already configured GRUB2 user
# except the special value 'unrestricted' is set via GRUB_RESCUE_USER="unrestricted"
# which creates the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry so that it can be booted by anyone
# which means anyone who can boot the currently running system can replace it via "rear recover".
# When GRUB_RESCUE_USER is empty rear does not do a GRUB2 user related setup
# so that the already existing GRUB2 users configuration determines
# which users can boot the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry.
# Usually this means anyone can boot 'Relax-and-Recover' which means anyone
# who can boot the currently running system can replace it via "rear recover".
GRUB_RESCUE_USER=""
# The former GRUB2 superuser setup support in rear via GRUB_SUPERUSER is dropped and
# also the former GRUB2 password setup support in rear via GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD is dropped.
# Both kind of setup can change the behaviour of the GRUB2 bootloader as a whole in unexpected ways
# but rear is not meant to change the general GRUB2 configuration of the currently running system.
# It works by default reasonably backward compatible when formerly a GRUB_SUPERUSER was used
# which means a GRUB2 superuser was set up by rear in /etc/grub.d/01_users with GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD
# so that the empty GRUB_RESCUE_USER results that the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry
# can only be booted by the formerly set GRUB_SUPERUSER with the formerly set GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD.

# The next variable can explitly specify whether or not an UEFI bootloader should be used:
# USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=   means let rear try to find it out by itself (default)
# USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=0  means we do not want UEFI capable ISO and no efi tools in rear image
