# local disk. Please note that a backup to a local disk is not a disaster recovery backup.
#
# NETFS saves the system to a network file system. Supported are all filesystems that your
# system can handle, for some exotic filesystems you might have to extend Relax-and-Recover
# to correctly handle the URL or provide custom mount/umount commands.

# How to exclude something ----- EXCLUDES -------
#
# You cannot exclude a device (e.g. /dev/sdg) directly. Instead you have to exclude everything
# ON that device and then the dependancy tracker will automatically exclude the device from the
# recovery (because there won't be any recovery information for that "unnecessary" device).
#
# Furthermore, you have to exclude MD devices and LVM2 volume groups separately as there is no
# automatic detection of these dependancies (yet, please write and submit it !)

# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. Will be automatically added to the
# $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array during backup to prevent the excluded filesystems' data to
# be backed up
