# local disk. Please note that a backup to a local disk is not a disaster recovery backup.
#
# NETFS saves the system to a network file system. Supported are all filesystems that your

# to correctly handle the URL or provide custom mount/umount commands.

# Also, do not forget to open the TCP/UDP ports on the NFS server (iptables)!

# arguments with blanks
# NOTE: The EXTERNAL_* commands will be run inside eval like this:

# Command to restore the data
EXTERNAL_RESTORE="ssh vms cat rear64/backup.tar.gz | tar -C /mnt/local -x -z"

# This example is useful for rsync
EXTERNAL_IGNORE_ERRORS=( 23 24 )

# How to exclude something ----- EXCLUDES -------
#
# You cannot exclude a device (e.g. /dev/sdg) directly. Instead you have to exclude everything
# ON that device and then the dependancy tracker will automatically exclude the device from the
# recovery (because there won't be any recovery information for that "unnecessary" device).
#
# Furthermore, you have to exclude MD devices and LVM2 volume groups separately as there is no
# automatic detection of these dependancies (yet, please write and submit it !)

# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. Will be automatically added to the
# $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array during backup to prevent the excluded filesystems' data to
# be backed up

# physical and logical volumes that belong to the excluded volume group.
