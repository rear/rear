# Older releases of os-prober (1.74 and below) use dmsetup as a fallback
# solution for mounting when grub-mount is missing.
#
# However, dmsetup was included in the rescue image if and only if LVM,
# multipath or encryption were detected.  Thus, BIOS machines that do
# not use these but still have dmsetup present, would block indefinitely
# on the "Installing GRUB2 boot loader..." step.
#
# GRUB2 installation is performed in a chroot after the data have already
# been recovered.  ReaR would call grub-mkconfig which calls os-prober
# which then executes dmsetup.  However, it would never receive the expected
# response in the form of releasing a System V semaphore by dmsetup executed
# by udevd outside the chroot as rescue system would not have dmsetup present.
#
