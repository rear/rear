# Example config for PXE based on GRUB2 booting on PPC64/PPC64LE
# (instead of PXE legacy that is not supported on PPC64/PPC64LE)
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1339

# Default is to create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
# set OUTPUT to change that
# set BACKUP to activate an automated (backup and) restore of your data.
# Possible configuration values can be found in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

# SAN and multipath and boot on SAN specific part on PPC64/PPC64LE:
# There is no direct link between multipath/boot_on_SAN and PXE (even on POWER).
# Multipath is used in this example because PowerVM LPARs usually need multipath.
# There is nothing special on PowerVM LPAR with single VIOS but that is not commonly used.
# In contrast PowerVM LPAR with DUAL VIOS (HA configuration) needs multipath
# for dual disk access (vscsi over 2 VIOS) or NPIV (Fiber Channel virtualization).
# And NPIV (which is quite popular) needs also BOOT_ON_SAN.
AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n
BOOT_OVER_SAN=y

# PXE on GRUB2 booting on PPC64/PPC64LE specific part:
OUTPUT=PXE

PXE_CONFIG_GRUB_STYLE=y
# On your TFTP server:
# In your tftpboot dir execute the following command to create the netboot directory based on GRUB.
# grub2-mknetdir --net-directory=/var/lib/tftpboot
# config directory will be /var/lib/tftpboot/boot/grub2/powerpc-ieee1275
