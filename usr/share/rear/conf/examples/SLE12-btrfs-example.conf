# Begin example setup for SLE12 with default btrfs subvolumes.
# This will not work with default btrfs on SLES12-SP1 because support for btrfs in ReaR
# explicitly excludes snapshot subvolumes but on SLES12-SP1 what is mounted at '/'
# will be a btrfs snapshot subvolume (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556).
# You must adapt "your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup" at BACKUP_URL.
# You must decide whether or not you want to have /home/* in the backup.
# It depends on the size of your harddisk whether or not /home is by default
# a btrfs subvolume or a separated xfs filesystem on a separated partition.
# You may activate SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD and adapt the "password_on_the_rear_recovery_system".
# For basic information see the SLE12 manuals.
# Also see the support database article "SDB:Disaster Recovery"
# at http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery
# In particular note:
# There is no such thing as a disaster recovery solution that "just works".
# Regarding btrfs snapshots:
# Recovery of btrfs snapshot subvolumes is not possible.
# Only recovery of "normal" btrfs subvolumes is possible.
# Create ReaR recovery system as ISO image:
OUTPUT=ISO
# Store the backup file via NFS on a NFS server:
BACKUP=NETFS
# BACKUP_OPTIONS variable contains the NFS mount options and
# with 'mount -o nolock' no rpc.statd (plus rpcbind) are needed:
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
# If the NFS server is not an IP address but a hostname,
# DNS must work in the ReaR recovery system when the backup is restored.
BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup
# Keep an older copy of the backup in a HOSTNAME.old directory
# provided there is no '.lockfile' in the HOSTNAME directory:
NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=yes
# Files in btrfs subvolumes are excluded by 'tar --one-file-system'
# so that such files must be explicitly included to be in the backup.
# Files in the following SLE12 default btrfs subvolumes are
# in the below example not included to be in the backup
#   /.snapshots/*  /var/crash/*
# but files in /home/* are included to be in the backup.
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home/*' '/var/tmp/*' '/var/spool/*' '/var/opt/*' '/var/log/*' '/var/lib/pgsql/*' '/var/lib/mailman/*' '/var/lib/named/*' '/usr/local/*' '/tmp/*' '/srv/*' '/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi/*' '/opt/*' '/boot/grub2/i386-pc/*' )
# This option defines a root password to allow SSH connection
# whithout a public/private key pair
#SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="password_on_the_rear_recovery_system"
# Let the ReaR recovery system run dhclient to get an IP address
# instead of using the same IP address as the original system:
#USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
# End example setup for SLE12 with default btrfs subvolumes.
