# Begin example setup for SLE11 with default ext3 filesystem.
# You must adapt "your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup" at BACKUP_URL.
# You may activate SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD and adapt the 'password_on_the_rear_recovery_system'.
# For basic information see the SLE11 manuals.
# Also see the support database article "SDB:Disaster Recovery"
# at http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery
# In particular note:
# There is no such thing as a disaster recovery solution that "just works".
# Create the ReaR recovery system as ISO image:
OUTPUT=ISO
# Store the backup file via NFS on a NFS server:
BACKUP=NETFS
# BACKUP_OPTIONS variable contains the NFS mount options and
# with 'mount -o nolock' no rpc.statd (plus rpcbind) are needed:
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
# If the NFS server is not an IP address but a hostname,
# DNS must work in the ReaR recovery system when the backup is restored.
BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup
# Keep an older copy of the backup in a HOSTNAME.old directory
# provided there is no '.lockfile' in the HOSTNAME directory:
NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=yes
# Set a root password for the ReaR recovery system in a confidential way
# to allow SSH connection without a public/private key pair.
# Never use your original root password here:
#{ SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='password_on_the_rear_recovery_system' ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV
# Let the ReaR recovery system run dhclient to get an IP address
# instead of using the same IP address as the original system:
#USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
# End example setup for SLE11 with default ext3 filesystem.
