== What is Relax and Recover ?
_Tool that implements a DR workflow for Linux_

Which basically means ?

  - Easy to deploy (set up and forget)
  - Makes recovery as easy as possible
  - Complete bare-metal disaster recovery
  - Integration for various Linux technologies
  - Integration with various back-up solutions
  - Modular framework written in Bash
  - Easy to extend to own needs


== How does Rear work ?
Rear builds a rescue image from the existing installation

  - Restored system is an accurate copy
  - Restored system supports the hardware
  - Exotic setups (kernel, hardware) guaranteed to work
  - What worked before keeps on working
  - Recovery is fully automated

Backup software is integrated into rescue image

  - With a working configuration


== Why is a backup not sufficient ?
Backup only covers storing data safely/securely

  - Often only the data is available
  - DR is a manual and time-consuming process

So manual disaster recovery risks:

  - unknown system storage and network configuration
  - incompatibilities between firmware/software/hardware
    * using newer tools with older data (or vice versa)
    * hardware is not supported
  - making manual mistakes (again and again)
  - working against the clock amidst chaos
  - frustration


== What does Rear bring to the table ?
But the Rear rescue image takes care of the complete
recovery process until the system runs:

  - enabling the network and remote access
  - using tools to recreate an accurate/working copy
  - recreating hardware and software RAID
  - partitioning and creating file systems
  - starting the backup restore process
  - restoring the bootloader


== Rear functionality
* Supported storage technologies
  - HP SmartArray, SW RAID, DRBD, LVM, multipath
  - ext2/ext3/ext4, xfs, jfs, vfat, btrfs, LUKS

* Boot media or remote storage
  - OBDR tape, ISO, USB, eSATA, network booting
  - NFS, CIFS, rsync, HTTP, FTP, SFTP, ...

* Back-up backends
  - IBM TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup,
    Bacula, tar, rsync


== How is Rear used ?
* Creating Rear boot media: +rear mkrescue+
  - Copies kernel, modules, minimal system
  - Saves storage layout, network configuration
  - Write boot media

* Restore system
  - Boot Rear media
  - Optionally, modify storage/network config
  - Run: +rear recover+
  - Rear parses layout then creates diskrestore script
  - Rear initiates restore or prompts for restore

== Nifty features to help relax
* Local GRUB integration (password protected)

* Serial console support (think: disaster)

* History-stuffing during recovery

* Network and SSH key integration

* Layout code guides you through recovery
  - Menu's and command-line in one session
  - Provides original storage info

* Beep, UID led and USB suspend integration

* Syslinux management

* Log-file on recovery media


== Use case: Belgian Federal Police /1
* Requirements:
  - About 200 sites with each a set of Linux servers
  - Each server comes with a tape-drive
  - Single bootable tape to:
    ** Restore complete system
    ** Restore from back-up
  - Support for various technologies
    ** HP SmartArray, SW RAID, DRBD, LVM
    ** OBDR, Bacula tape support
    ** RHEL 4, RHEL5 and RHEL6 support
  - End-user documentation in 3 languages


== Use case: Belgian Federal Police /2
* Solution:
  - All requirements implement but...
  - New systems didn't support bootable tape (OBDR)
  - USB is much more flexible than tape
    ** Can store multiple rescue images
    ** Can store rescue images of multiple servers
    ** Easier workflow (udev): insert, wait, pull (2 min max)
    ** Cheaper
    ** Implementation is more reliable
  - Bonus implementation of flexible layout
  - Support migration scenarios


== Use case: Belgian Federal Police /3
* Rear config for USB rescue media:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=BACULA
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
----

* Rear config for USB backup media:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=NETFS
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( vg00 )
EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( /data )
----


== Use case: Belgian Federal Police /4
* Rear config for OBDR rescue tapes:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=BACULA
OUTPUT=OBDR
BEXTRACT_DEVICE=Ultrium-1
BEXTRACT_VOLUME=VOL-*
----

* Rear config for OBDR backup tapes:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=NETFS
OUTPUT=OBDR
TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
----

== Use case: Centralized images /1
* Requirements:
  - Remote rescue images
  - Removable media for off-site storage
  - Easy restore of physical hosts and guests

* Solution:
  - Cron creates image when Rear detects change
  - Images pushed through HTTP to PXE server/host
  - Stored on USB disks, rotated every week


== Use case: Centralized images /2
* Label USB disk(s) and mount

* Configure Apache to allow HTTP PUT to USB disk

* Rear config in _/etc/rear/local.conf_:

[source,bash]
----
BACKUP=BACULA
OUTPUT=ISO
ISO_URL=http://server:port/path/
----

* Rear cron-job at /etc/cron.d/rear:
----
30 0 1 * * root /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
30 1 * * * root /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

== Hacking on Rear
* It is Bash !

* Join the mailinglist

* Understand modular framework and workflows
  - Use: +rear -s <workflow>+

* Logging
  - Logfile in: _/tmp/rear-hostname.log_

* Debugging
  - Verbose: +rear -v+
  - Debug: +rear -d+
  - Tracing: +rear -D+


== Project future
* Functionality
  - Improved rsync support (like rsnapshot or rbme)
  - More back-up backend integration
  - PXE integration

* Development
  - Re-organize code base
  - Release management needs a process
  - Website and documentation not up-to-date
  - Change of development tools ?
