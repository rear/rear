This is the preparation part of rear before starting the rescue build phase.

Please note that you should not put any scripts that reference
$ROOTFS_DIR or $VAR_DIR/recovery into this section. Scripts for $ROOTFS_DIR
go to rescue/ and for $VAR_DIR/recovery go to layout/ respectively

That way we keep only the real prep stuff here in the prep section.
