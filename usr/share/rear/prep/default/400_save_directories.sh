# Purpose of this script is to save permissions, owner, group
# or symbolic link name and target of basic directories in a file.
# That file will be read during recovery time to recreate those directories.
# The script restore/default/900_create_missing_directories.sh will recreate
# those directories if they were not already recreated (e.g. via backup restore)
# and all other code or scripts that also does this could/should be deleted.

# First save directories that are used as mountpoints:
# FIXME: To exclude unwanted "noise" from mountpoints a simple 'grep -vE "this|that"'
# is not fail safe because it excludes any lines that contain 'this' or 'that'.
# Using 'grep -vE "type (this|that) "' makes it look like bloatware code
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1459#discussion_r135744282
# but currently I <jsmeix@suse.de> prefer "bloatware code" that works fail safe
# over simple code that sometimes fails, cf. "Dirty hacks welcome"
# at https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style

# BUILD_DIR can be used in 'grep -vE "this|$BUILD_DIR|that"' because it is never empty (see usr/sbin/rear)
# because with any empty part 'grep  -vE "this||that"' would output nothing at all:
local excluded_other_stuff="/sys/|$BUILD_DIR|REAR-000"
# The trailing space in 'type ($excluded_fs_types) |' is intentional:
