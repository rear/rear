# Purpose of this script is to save permissions, owner, group
# or symbolic link name and target of basic directories in a file.
# That file will be read during recovery time to recreate those directories.
# The script restore/default/900_create_missing_directories.sh will recreate
# those directories if they were not already recreated (e.g. via backup restore)
# and all other code or scripts that also does this could/should be deleted.

# FIXME: Dirty hack to fix https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3222 for now
# until a proper solution is found, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3223
# When "rear mkrescue" is run for the very first time on a system or within a 'git clone' directory
# this script would fail because $VAR_DIR/recovery/ is not yet created when this script runs
# because $VAR_DIR/recovery/ gets normally created later in
# layout/save/GNU/Linux/100_create_layout_file.sh ('prep' runs before 'layout/save')
# so we create $VAR_DIR/recovery here same as it is done in 100_create_layout_file.sh

# FIXME: To exclude unwanted "noise" from mountpoints a simple 'grep -vE "this|that"'
# is not fail safe because it excludes any lines that contain 'this' or 'that'.
# Using 'grep -vE " type (this|that) "' makes it look like bloatware code
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1459#discussion_r135744282
