# 40_save_mountpoint_details.sh
# Purpose of this script is to save the ownership and permissions of the mount points in a file
# That file will be read during recovery time to recreate missing directories and set up the proper
# permissions again (for the moment it is scattered across different flows)
# Script restore/default/90_create_missing_directories.sh will recreate the missing dirs (all other
# script may be deleted)
